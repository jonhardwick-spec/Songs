[Chorus]
…scam my fans
We can split it down a ‘mil, do you have an SSN?
Do you work at T-Mobile? If you do, lock me in
Because I could punch a hundred phones in two days without walking in (Easy)
[Verse]
That's $100,000 in two days
Punch a phone or hit a *****, we can make that in two ways
I came a long way from playing on 2K
I’m not sitting on the game, I'm outside busting a play (Peasant)
You're not rich, but I am we don't relate (At all)
I'm a multi-million dollar criminal with super pape' (Millionaire)
Richest rapper from my city and my state
Everytime I leave my house, I got bitches yelling my name
Everytime I get around a bitch, she begging for my chain
You sell pics on OnlyFans for $5, that's a shame
It's a $140,000 pendant without thе chain
If I let you wear this bitch, it'll nevеr hit the same
I know you can't afford it, get the fuck up out my face
Never mind, you got good credit, let me take you on a date (Come on) I'm trying to open up three loans using your name
Quit that job and come and work for me, I'm giving better rates
You can't afford to sit with me, I paid 500 for this steak
I paid 600 for this cup, I guess I got expensive taste
I paid 700 for these jeans, they unreleased, you got to wait
I paid 800 for these shoes, I wore them once, threw them away
