They think that I'm perfect but I'm not
I got pain too
Niggas switch up on me call me fake, that's what that fame do
Now I'm riding by myself ain't fucking with the same group
Now they see I'm eating, now they wish they had a plate too
I grew up without my dad, had to do this on my own
Last year I was down bad, I ain't want to live at all
I remember being sad, I was finna risk it all
They all left me in the past, they ain't give a fuck at all
Niggas think my life was sweet but I been through the hardest times
All this pain and darkness I still find a way to shine
I got locked up on 2 charges, that shit made my momma cry
Heard her crying through the phone, I know tears was in her eyes
I said "we gon be okay". I know I'm gon beat this case
And if I die today, I know I'm going to be great
Shout out Barry he stay solid, he ain't ever been a fake
Shout out mama [?] too, she made sure I always ate
Ain't nobody hold me down, niggas just can't fuck on me
They ain't fucking with me now
Niggas can't keep up with me
I'm just gon stay down for myself, cause people just keep hurting me
And I ain't ever need no help, that's why ya'll ain't heard from me
Cancer made my uncle die, I ain't even shed a tear
I just hold it all inside, swear I haven't cried in years
Can't keep fucking with my mind, I keep thinking my time near
I keep telling people I'm fine, whole I'm holding back these tears
Imagine signing deals, straight to top, just to lose it all
Everything got ripped away from me, I coulda had it all
I was trying to see my niggas eat, cause we gon all ball
I know God a plan for me, and stressing that all
I know who gon ride and die for me
I know if I disappear I know the ones who cry for me
I know if the world against me, I know who gon side with me
And if I ever get into it I know who gon slide for me
I know they don't know my struggles, they can never feel my shoes
I ain't changing on my guys, cause that's what these bitches do
And I'll never fall behind, me and [?] can never lose
And to you I never lie
Why couldn't you tell the truth
I can't even act surprised
I just knew this shit would happen
You kept doing all this fake shit, it just turned into a habit
All that preaching bout being solid only real up in that [?]
Put all my problems in my music and I love it with a passion
