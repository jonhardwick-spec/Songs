[Intro]
C'mon
(
I'm smokin' straight out the pack
)
[Verse]
Get a pack and send it straight over to Mexico
I'm tryna pour another line, stop at the Texaco
I quit pressin' pills a week ago, I'm sick I let 'em go
I lied, I'm still pressin' fent' pills and don't nobody know
Every single one of us untouched, who gon' up the score?
Who got a thousand pack of real percs? I really want to know
I dropped the addy to his phone again, he was a no-show
If you steal from me I gotta kill you, that's a no-go
If I need a body I'ma pay for that
Everybody wanted to be rich, I made a wave for that
I'm important, I'ma skip the line, I never wait at Sak's
Drop 60,000 on Cuban's, next week I made it back
You only got beef with Punchmade cause bro done took yo' strap
He wear designer for a day then take a pic and then go take it back (Ham)
You're a top tier hambag
My bitch know how to move, my Draco tucked inside her handbag
I think the feds is on my bank account, they got a scam tag
$100,000 ain't even close to what my hands had
He thought he got a hunnid P's from me, it was a sandbag
Thats the true definition of a hambag
