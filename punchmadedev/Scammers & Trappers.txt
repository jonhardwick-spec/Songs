[Lyrics From Snippet]
When I go out of town I ain't linking with rappers
Where all the scammers and trappers
Where all the scammers on Instagram that don't be capping
I'm trying to make some happen
This Glock got a switch on it I'm ready for action
They say I can't come to the city
I should be dead right now nothing never happened
I took your money and I'm still alive
You should go follow me on Instagram
I'm probably flexing with it online
Look, there go your money right there go check it out online
Go to My YouTube channel right now I'm spending your money like it's mine
I know you're mad you'll never get it back
Why'd you leave a comment on My page asking me to send your back
Are you a dumbass, look at the video I already spent that
Look at the chain I'm wearing right now that's where the money is at (Ha)
