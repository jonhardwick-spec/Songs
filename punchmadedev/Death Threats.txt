[Intro]
I’m smokin’ straight out the pack
Come on
Mmm-mmm-mmm, work for me
Why would I go—
Why would I go back and forth with you when you can work for me
Alright
[Verse]
Why would I go back and forth with you when you can work for me
Come print a fake check or press a perc for me (Come on)
Or stand outside the crib, look out for 12, stay on alert for me
Come correct and pay that ticket, you can learn from me
New death threat everyday, somebody tell me they gon murder me (Come on)
Put up that petty ass roll of twenties, it’s startin to hurt to see
I don’t mind comin for my chain, I want a first-degree (Come on)
I don’t mind, if you think I’m a stain, come do the worst to mе
I’m real comfortable standin outside whеre the junkies be (Come correct)
Cause I don’t mind handin out fake pills, I made a bunch of these (Plenty of them)
This time nobody died, I’m finna up the fee
I never had to catch a ham outside and make him run from me (Come here)
It get dangerous when I set the play, next day, it’s done for me
I’m so racist, I'll pop a black person if he tussle me
I don’t like broke ass people close to touchin me
I would erase every single peasant if it was up to me (Fuck away)
Fifty-thousand on me, mean muggin, I’m a asshole
Legend in my city, they gon call me when the bag slow
Yeah, you had some old motion before, but now you back broke
I disappear and always come back richer than my last post
Drop my bitch and always come back quicker with a bad hoe
My new bitch know how to scam, and she way thicker than my last hoe
Thanks to Cash App, everyday I wake up, I go stash pros
Come get the glitch from me, I’ll make it flip if that’s yo last hope (Come on)
Scared to take a risk and make it flip, that’s why yo ass broke
Check my bank account, it say “Cash App” in every cash flow (On God)
Find a brand new workin glitch, and now my bags swole
Hit my Telegram, and I might give you yo exact row
