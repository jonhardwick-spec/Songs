[Verse]
Everybody listen up, this a punch lesson
Go and get a fire carding site, go to the dump section
Never get a savings account dump, you always want checking
Make sure you go and grab a credit dump, they never hit with debit
You better put a
proxy server
on it or use public connection
You can’t get too comfortable on there, get the proper protection
When you surfing on the dark web, you might get an infection
I can put a virus on computers without any detection
Now you need some clonеd cards, not them white blanks
Why would you go and use that anyway? It don’t say a bank
I likе to use my old debit cards, the one I got from ChaseSo when I go and pull the card out, it got the proper face (Okay)
You gon' need the proper software
No, dumbass, you don't need
EMV software
That's only if you tryna code the chip they put on there
You just need a
MSR
, plus the
Deftun
software
Once you got the items on that list, you can start here
Load up
the software you just got, make sure the card near
You might have to scratch the numbers off to match the card year
The clerk really not gon' say shit if you show no fear
(Okay)
Swipe the card thru the MSR, erase the info
Then plug in
Track 1 and Track 2
and write the info
Now it's time for you slide straight to the store, see what it hit for
It's gon' look and work like a real card, no need to tip toe
This a credit dump, so you can only use the mag strip
The clerk gon' let you swipe the card after you
jam the chip
After it ain’t working 2 times, she’ll let you use the stripIf your piece keep saying declined, then that’s your sign for you to dip (Get outta there)
