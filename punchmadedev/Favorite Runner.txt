[Intro: Random Girl]
This guy actually is really nice and funny but the sums weren't alot and
I could see the spend that he did on my on on my cards
[Verse 1: Punchmade Dev]
I made the leaderboards on my site, cuz' I'm a daily puncher
She gave me neck first, then take me on the road she been my favorite runner
The pape' we touching off of one trip will take you fifty summers
(One, two)
That's gon' take you about fifty years
I'm in the club doing my dance with my pole in here
He wasn't gangster until court came, hе broke the code in thеre (Rat)
He in there snitching on his own mans
Diors or Balenciagas, I don't own Vans
What the fuck I look like wearing those?
Everybody in my circle turnt, y'all still be sharing clothes
(Hold on I ain't gon lie), we be sharing hoes
We be running through these bitches, you gon buy her bags and clothes
(I'm shaking my head)
That's a damn shame
My bitch gotta punch a hunnid' phones before she get a ring
And I'ma make her write a hunnid' dumps, just so she know the game
So when we post a picture for the gram, our mits look the same
Yeah, me and my bitch gon' both have them racks
We gon' hit our plays together and give the bank a heart attack
I'll never forget where I started at
Not too long ago I used to turn up when I touched a rack
But, look how the tables turned
Swiping too easy, we in the parking lot taking turns
My runner inside the store, while I calculate PROs that we earned
I keep a couple bitches at a time but they taking they turn
