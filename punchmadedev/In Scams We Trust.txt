[Chorus]
Of course I'm gonna leave after I fuck you, gullible bitch
Get the neck from you than leave, I ain’t cuffing you bitch
I pray to god we don't get flicked, the puncher in the whip
Apple phones in my cart, if I decline I'm running off with it
Last ham who ran off with the bank play I think his disappeared
Walk in and talk [?] to the clerk, and whisper in her ear
That hundred bands you had on Instagram I had that last year
For you, if it wasn’t for EDD you'd have a bad year
[Verse]
You gotta hop inside the whip when I pull up, I don't do hand-to-hands
I think when I was flying first class I've prolly seen yo mans
To a different country, it's gon be a day until I land
I'm blowing woods, somewhere in Jamaica Chilling in the sand
You prolly shouldn't have started a war with me without the upper hand
You just drove for 7 hours, went inside
You a runner man
He just seen me up a big [?]
Now i'm Brotherman
I’m a well-known shitter, got a song with BabyTron and Stan
I know I’m fucking up
Cuz I just nutted on another fan
My food came from [?]
I just seen you open up a can
Lobster, with the mac and cheese that's a baby band
I robbed her, outta SSN and made another bin
You only point guns at the phone, you a camera killer
I ain’t like the way he looking at me, send my mans to kill him
I didn't like the way your bitch look, I sent my mans to hit her
I'm up some dogshit, and you're a [?]
I could be richer
