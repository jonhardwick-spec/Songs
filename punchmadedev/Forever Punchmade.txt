[Verse]
Give me a Chase account, I could bust that down
Before I slide in the store, I make a punch-punch sound
Three hunnid K sitting in my chase, I'm up-up now
I got three hundred thousand in my Chase, another hunnid in cashAdded up that's four hunnid thousand, not including my stash
If I'm lying, God could kill me now
I could care less about rap, I'll quit right now
I can't lie, music never paid my bills
The way it's looking, I'ma have to trap and scam to a mil
I'd rather jugg hams, fuck a deal
A hundred K in all blues, I'm really rich for real
If you bring me an aged bank account, then we can hit for real
Just got my hands on some real perks, I'ma hit em' still
Oh he got autism? I don't care, I'ma jugg him still
Once he send thе bread, I'ma text him like "How that feel?"
Thеy won't let me in a store, I got a punching habit
Took somebody's pape', and then I spent it like I'm posed' to have it
My brother got a body every now and then he post-traumatic
I cheated on my bitch a couple of times, she so dramatic
I'm not Durkio, I'll put a bitch on my block list
My life illegal, I'll put a snitch on my drop list
My life expensive, everything is Saks on my cop list
Trying to keep my circle out of jail
, they like to pop shit
You took too many pictures with that Glock, I think it's time to shoot it
We Punchmade, out of Lexington, they hate we got a movement
Everything we do exquisite, we should shoot a movieI'm paranoid, don't come walking up, I'll shoot a groupie
