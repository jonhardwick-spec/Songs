[Intro: Adam22, Teejayx6]
You know when I was listening to your music I had an idea a festival a music festival and we call it "Fall off fest" a ton of different rappers who kind of like fell offJust tryna be funny?Not really
[Chorus]
I'm up seven mil little bro got none tell him come catch up with me
It's been a while since I checked up on my son he got ran out the city
I bet he can't *chain* cause that nigga struggling he can't keep up with me
He fell off now he's a bum on my life he can't show fifty
[Verse]
You don't got a car go ahead and pay for a Lyft and then wait on the curb
He ain't a scammer that nigga bе lying
He went sold his chain and I know that that hurt
Thesе si diamonds pissing me off I might have to tuck this bitch in my shirt
Its been years I'm still getting off
Teejay or Quan who fell off the worst
I know it sucks to wake up piss poor broke than a bitch
Just think about it since you fell off after that deal you ain't had no kid
Don't compare me to them
They had to sign their life away then they was rich
You made that label advance look good all the way up till the money was spent
I'm getting tired of y'all acting like y'all scam It don't add up with them fits
I just cashed out on a urus today and I barely be rapping go make it make sense
I got millions of dollars to show and I still don't even have one hit
That broke ass nigga told a hoe he was paying for pussy and then ran off on a bitch
I'm really rich not like him I'm really rich for real
He had to sign a deal that's the only reason he ever seen a mil
*chain* Bitch how that feel *chain*
I didn't have to sign no deal
