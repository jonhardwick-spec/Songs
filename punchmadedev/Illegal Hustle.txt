[Intro]
With this illegal hustle I'ma get a bag or sit
I'ma get bag or sit inside a cell
Come on
[Verse]
With this illegal hustle, l'ma get a bag or sit inside a cell
I been busting credit cards from my computer trying to pay myself
I can make your daily profit 30 times before you make a sale
If I was trying to trap without a car, I would hate myself
Posting that petty ass mid on Instagram, I woulda been embarrassed
This thirty-ball wrapped around my wrist got the bitches staring
All y'all posting with the same Glock the whole clique been sharing
That's the same jacket from my video that your bitch been wearing
I got a stash house just for money out of Nicholasville
I never knew I'd get halfway rich off of pressing a pill
If punching slowed down I'd grab a P and jump back in the field
You can't hide you was shopping Clearance tryna snatch you a steal
Stop acting like you out here punching with a weak ass bin
Been giving free sauce out for days I like to treat my fans
I'm like a janitor walk in the bank and then sweep out bands
I'm super self paid off of fraud, I don't need no advance
It get cold where I'm at that's why the coat cost a thousand
Order seven Monclers, I do the most when I'm browsing
Always had a boujee life, I never lived in public housing
It's a good day, I always celebrate when the pounds in
Using fake check templates, I'm just typing the amount in
Big prada boots look like I'm finna climb a mountain
When I build my first crib, I'ma get a wocky fountain
My bitch getting tired, I told her ass to keep counting
