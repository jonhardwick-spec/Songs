[Intro]
He had such a bright future ahead. One of the more than 2400 people killed in Arizona last year by an opioid overdose. He wasn't even trying to get high. He thought was an anti anxiety pill that turned out to be laced with fentanyl
[Verse]
I can't lie I'm kind of sick I lost my favorite fiend
I was pressing up all kinds of pills, and you tried everything
I won't forget the time you told the block to come buy everything
I had a long list, but you was different from my every fiend
We can't forget about that one night
I made a Perc 60 with fentanyl, and you threw up twice
That's how I know that the pill was right
My pills either have you turnt up, or fucked up in life
Here go a pill, I'll never ask you twice
The night before, I stayed up super late making the tabs right
I was trying to make sure I had the stats right
Long live Heather, I never knew that would be your last bite (Rest in piss)
But I can't lie, It's a good thing you died
I would never know the right mix if you never tried
I still got your favorite pill set aside, the same one you died from, I'ma to sell it to who testifies
Never mind, I sold it to a junkie trying to catch a high
I lie like I rap about GTA in each and every line
That's the glitch, on how to tell the truth but still don't do the time
I can flex a hunnid K in cash, cuz' I take care of mine
But you can't cuz' they'll rob your ass
We Punchmade, we got too much pape to switch up for a bag
Rocket pulled up on me with some Xans, I'm like trade me for that
Here go a pint when I flood the city, I'll pay you right back
Hit the block, now I'm busting it down
Tomorrow I'ma do the same thing in a smaller town
I'm somewhere in Kentucky just lurking around
I'm the real reason why we got fake perkys around
