[Intro]
Come on
Thank you Ro that is so sweet
[Chorus]
This a rich party, you can't get in wearing a cookies tee
Im a real fraud junkie, i hit a hundred plays in just a week
Embosser plus a puncher in my crib, they think im pushing p
Im a true punch legend i pat the stats in my rookie week
If you bring over 20 credit cards then you can book with me
Scratch that, give me a thousand pills and a pint of lean
I could drop a step by step guide on how to hook a fiend
Just cut a real pill mix it with fent thats how you cook a bean
[Verse]
Im pouring potions in the punch palace im doing visa magic
You pay for her nails and still ain't fuck you had atleast a bad bitch
I scribbled names on a death note and then paid out the backend
My shooter locked in seven people died this week was tragic
Why would i go and slide myself when i could pay for that
I spent 10k a day in just two days i probably made it back
I could have paid your bitch rent i went and spent that on a gucci hat
Put illegal firearms and debit cards in my louis bag
On the road my bitch keep snapping pics with her bougie ass
I can't decide what cartier i want with my choosie ass
He secretly competed with punchmade but he losing bad
Just touched two hundred thousand from my crib you still stuck in the trap
I think its time to hang that jersey up
Im from the burbs but i could teach you how to press a percie up
We punchmade we fucked up every sax i know you heard of us
We the richest punchers in the city they wanna murder us
