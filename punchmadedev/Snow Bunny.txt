[Intro]
(Hahaha Jerry, what the fuck?)
[Verse]
Blues bustin' out my pocket, I'm a heavyweight
(Blues)
Send my snow bunny out of town, made her catch the weight
(She fat)
She wanna hit the road again, we make better pay
(Come on)
We touched 20 on our last trip and missed a better play
(Let's go)
You would prolly catch me out dancing by the sub ?
(Yeah)
Imma hit the ATM, scam-dancing while I up bands
Stuffed a UPS full of bulls, I'm the truck man
Yo mans always asking for the dollar, he the buck man
(Huh)
They can't see the stick poking 'cos it's tucked in
(Nah)
Don't let yo mans in the street, keep him tucked in
(Hе gon' die)
It's time for you to quit the trap, you can't up 10
(Quit)
Now hе on there bitching on his snap, saying fuck friends
I paid 25 for that back door
(25)
Yeah we got the bulls from your crib, come get it back ho
Pull the strap out, soon as he run, hit his back-bone
My phone keep ringing back to back, that's my crack phone
(Trap)
Imma wake up, crack my knuckles and punch a piece
I just got a 90-pack of dumps, it's a puncher week
(Yeah)
It's best for you to go and buy a gun 'cos your punch is weak
(Bitch)
You never had pape' behind school, your lunch was free
Your childhood was a penny tale
(Poor)
Your mama used to make you go and dig out the wishing well
The gangster polite, pop the opps then I wish 'em well
I can slam my way to the top, don't gotta kiss and tell
I don't do no dick sucking for a rank
(Nah)
I got my bitch dick sucking on the way to banks
(Yeah)
Catch me with a smile on my face on the way to Chase
Imma do the dash to the bank, it's a punching race
(I punch)
Catch me walking in a PNC with my puncher face
You were not a real card swiper, you going through a phase
(Alright)
My shooter hitting every moving target, put him in phase
