[Punchmade Dev]
80 for a three-five I′m blowing zaza
We got runts, bowls, credit cards & choppas in mi casa
Real punch goat when I see what I want next day I got it
I think I got him he just sent the payment twice it got me smiling
Look at them tiny ass pockets it's time you go take them Amiri′s back
Go get that strap, snatch it from your shooter cause he ran with that
I think Nordstrom banned me from they site cause i was catching jacks
It's too late, punched a few dеsigner fits, of course I'm coming back
Fake ID with mе inside the whip, I woke up and my name was Tyler
I′m nothing like the fox on Dora I′m successful when I'm swiping
Don′t ask for the wock I'm pouring I see purp I get excited
You got green wock in that double cup you basically is lying
Take that cap off cause we both know that ain′t no real mud
Fuck your boyfriend he prolly broke and can't up five dubs
I′m not surprised you can't pull 100 out your mitt
I posted with 100 bands and now the city think I'm rich
I could drop a 100 songs the fans would never say I missed
Of course I got the neck from her but she can′t never say we kissed
It′s time to move every bad bitch in the city I done hit
Man fuck a record deal I had like 50K before it hit on god
80 for a three-five I'm blowing zaza
We got runts, bowls, credit cards & choppas in mi casa
Real punch goat when I see what I want next day I got it
I think I got him he just sent the payment twice it got me smiling
Look at them tiny ass pockets it′s time you go take them Amiri's back
Go get that strap, snatch it from your shooter cause he ran with that
I think Nordstrom banned me from they site cause i was catching jacks
It′s too late, punched a few designer fits, of course I'm coming back
