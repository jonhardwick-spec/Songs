[Intro]
Three people all of this in connection with a growing fraud scam
One that targets the state's unemployment benefit system
Nearly 90 in total, all wanted for stealing tax dollars
Dollars intended for Californians who've lost their job during this pandemic
And why?
To go on lavish shopping sprees
[Chorus]
We gon' throw a celebration when the opps die
My shooter like to referee he like to kill em' when they outside
I wake up jugging every day don't take no break I scam at all times
I see you work at UPS and need a break but don't got haul times
They got a million different scammers in the world but I'm in the hall of fame
I was walking out of Apple with six phones using a different name
I'm rolling 3.5 exotic woods we ain't smoking the same
Yo homie dead as fuck rolled in my wood it ain't smoking the same
[Verse 1]
You got to the counter they told you the price and then you turned around
Unemployment hitting back-to-back I'm used to doing turn arounds
I take credit cards and empty out accounts I'm who you heard about
He was talking real reckless 2 days later he ain't heard about
They never run and get away I track em' down and find they whereabouts
I pull out my F and N I'm tryna find out what they starin' bout'
You moved out yo mommas house but still ain't got no chair and couch
I don't need a hall pass while I'm walking through the hood you need a vouch
