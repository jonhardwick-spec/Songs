[Chorus]
I got a circle full of scammers, not rap friends
He posting with that pistolBack in school he used to tap dance (Pussy)
Tell the junkies come and shop, I got the packs in
I heard your auntie fuck with fentanyl, told her come tap in (Come on)
I'm more protected, I use SOCKS5
Everybody want my BIN number, I can't drop mineYou'll probably never see my opps, I pay to drop mine
I'm the real reason why **** died at that stop sign
[Verse]
That's what happens when I blow the whistle
I can throw my shooter five bands and he gon' blow the pistol
I pay to make you disappear before an instrumental
Five thousand for a head tap, go hit him in his temple
Here go a Draco and a Glock, I sent him on a mission
Take a picture of his dead body after the face is missing
I want to put his dead body in a picture frame so I can put a caption on it sayin', "Fix your aim"
I'm really that
Every time I hang up on my bitch she always calling back
I told the bitch it's time to count my pros, there ain't no talking back
I'ma tie you up and kill your ass, don't steal behind my back
I'm from the burbs, don't play it crazy I can get you killed
Let's not pretend I ain't flood the city with these fake ass pills
Independent, but I look like I signed me a deal
Build a trust in backdooring for bread, bitch, I'm slimy for real
