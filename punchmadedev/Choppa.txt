[Intro]
Aye, aye, gang gang
Aye, aye, gang gang
Shoo, shoo, shoo (skrt!)
Aye, gang, aye
Choppa in the back and I'm finna let it blow
Draco hold a hundred rounds, aim this bitch at yo nose
Extended clips on a Mac and it came with a scope
Shootin' shit like Call of Duty you would think that I'm a pro
[Chorus 1]
Choppa in the back and I'm finna let it blow
Draco hold a hundred rounds, aim this bitch at yo nose
Extended clips on a Mac and it came with a scope
Shootin' shit like Call of Duty you would think that I'm a pro (gang)
Only rockin' with my brothas cause these n***as [?] a switch
Made a pussy n***a fall so that n***a wouldn't snitch
.223's hit his backs,
split a n***a like a Twix
(gang gang)
Keep blue hunnids in the bag, I be ballin' like the Knicks
(like the Knicks)
50 bands on my wrist and my neck is all froze
Gucci belt on my waist while I rock designer clothes
Pour a deuce in it finna lean got me movin' slow
And I will always chase a bag cause I will never chase a hoe (gang)
