[Verse]
I'm havin' a bad day, I'm already mad todayI've been on the block since 6 a.m. and I still ain't get paid (Fuck)
Fuck the trap today, I barely even hit a play (Fuck the trap)
How can I be happy when I still got bills I gotta pay? (I got bills)
I got rats and roaches where I stay
I still live in the hood, yeah, it's stained and moldy where I lay (It stinks)
I wish I could be rich for a day (I wish)
I been in these clothes for a week like this shit is okay
Right now I'm down bad, I'll kill somebody for some pape'
I would walk outside and rob a junkie if he had some pape'
I got nothin' to my name but twenty dollars, a Glock, and a vape
I fuck with ugly hoes, I can't afford bougie bitches and dates (I can't)
I'm Black and still collectin' change
My friends are peasants too, none of us got shit, we're all the same (We're all broke)At this point, we might as well just start a gang
Let's post pics on Instagram with guns to hide the fact that we're lame (We're lame as fuck)
They shot my mans and took him out the gameInstead of slidin', I'ma put his face inside a chain (That's sleek)
I'm poppin' Percs tryna fight the pain
I'm sick of being broke, it's probably time for me to make a change (I need motion)
I need motion, something's gotta change
I still haven't changed since high school, I feel super lame
Man, I'm way too broke to be my age
How the fuck did Dev just post a pic holdin' a hundred K?
What? He made thirty thousand in a day? (How)
I'ma text him right now like, "Put me on a play
" (Put me on, please)
He ain't answer, I knew he was lame
Bet, I'm finna go and drop some comments on his page
When I catch you, I'm killin' you and takin' that chain
I'm valid in these streets, I ain't have to rap to get my name
I'm known for tappin' heads with perfect aim
Dev's a whole bitch, he's from the 'burbs, that's an easy stain
I had free lunch, you had your lunch made
I can't go band for band, I'm on the block all about gun play (Let's shoot it out)
Fuck Punchmade
He's just another white kid from the 'burbs, I hate Punchmade
