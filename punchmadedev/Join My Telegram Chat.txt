[Intro]
Put like why, are they my role model?
I basically put like, you went from like, to like
Them being on top of the scam rap era
And then also creating your own record label
Which is dope as fuck, cause you could like, you know
Do your own shit, on your own terms and like
You're your own boss, you know what I'm sayin'
Just the type of shit I'm Tryna be on
[Verse]
If you tired of being broke and want some money join my Telegram chat
I got a step by step guide on how to quickly make a rack
If you spend your bread with me your guaranteed to make it back
I make $300,000 every month, let's check the stats
I'm having motion in my chat I can't speak for no one else
So don't come telling me your problems if you get scammed by someone else
Cause truly I don't give a fuck or care to help
It ain't hard to see who really rich, you did that to yourself
Cash app got me rich, I'ma send a thank you letter
I wake up and hit my cash app every day, who do it better?
From my phone I made a million with no effort
I can quit pressing up pills and load accounts its fuck heather
I see too many fake scammers, y 'all was never taking trips
They be lying when they say they took the risk
I see a lot of fake swipers, y 'all was never jammin' chips
You pulled out $20,000 in all 20s just to look rich
I'm flawless when I hit a play, I post it on my story
I got a bougie bitch who walk inside the bank and clear for me
Give me neck inside the whip, I got the Tesla steering for me
When she quit busting my plays, she ain't never hearing from me
