[Chorus]
Y'all out here wearing purple jeans the jeans I got they say Amiri
Your pockets full of lint your broke as fuck you need help severely
I blew the drac it had my ears ringing its fucking up my hearing
In sixty years, you'll touch a mill I do more then that yearly
I done rob and took from so many hams they wanna kill me
I be saying rich shit in all my songs you don't feel me
I got a top lawyer I catch a case I'm not guilty
I sit back and pay for hats and drop the pape off that's the drill fee
[Verse]
Its 2024 and you still don't got a tv in your room
He was reaching for my chain the last thing he heard was boom
If I die reaching for a chain make sure to write that on his tomb
Your still piss poor you got your son wеaring fruity looms
I'm rich in real life I don't gotta rap
I'm the onе who gets rap niggas **** I don't battle rap
Stop making shit up in your songs you dont got a hat
I'm on a bank run right now hit it back-to-back
I would've killed my own homie if I found out he was a rat
I thought I was dead on site he wanted to sit down and just chat
And I think that's kinda sad
You got your chain took and chased all down the street you went out bad
My amgs my daily bucket I be driving it all fast
This cars cheap as fuck its only 60k don't care to crash
