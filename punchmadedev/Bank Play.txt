[Chorus: Punchmade Dev]
PayPal was never dead, you just don’t know the new steps
Blue Triple S on my toes, these expensive blue steps
I’m tryna wipe somebody bank account, bypass the two step
Don’t disrespect Punchmade, that’s gon’ lead you straight to death
Twenty-four hours on a computer, I’ma scam my ass to death
If they shut my site down then I’m back to selling meth
Spray it down with fentanyl then let my auntie take the test
If she die off onе hit, I let my fiends take thе rest
[Verse: Punchmade Dev]
I’ll put your life at risk, do anything to get me rich
I need your Social and your date of birth, you wanna be my bitch?
Here, take this check, I wanna store it, take a risk
She can’t stay focused, she keep looking over at my wrist
I never need a EDD to change my financial situation
If I need pape’, then I’ma take it
Straight blues in my pocket, you won’t hear no changes shaking
Take that off fufu ass tennis chain you bought, it keeps on breaking
I’m a menace on the web, ban me from the internet
It’s best for you to hide your Instagram, I’m known for ending that
I’ll delete it, make you disappear
I could really make a street nigga break down in tears
I’m a different breed when I get behind my keyboard
Back in 2016, made fifty K being a e-whore
I lie like we gon’ split it down the middle but I’ma keep more
You’ll never catch me beefing with a ham that wears jean shorts
