[Intro: Teejayx6]
If you fuck with me, you fuck with me
If you hating on me, fuck you
If you see me out of public, I'ma murder you nigga
(Look who running)
[Verse]
Let me tell you bout' this one rapper who wanted smoke
A year ago he was on Instagram until I took it down
A year ago ago he had a rap career, try to go find it now
I caught him slipping inside Fayette mall, now he known as a clown
Thirty thousand for your head, don't be loafing around
I played a part of seven different ****** that dropped in my town
I make payments with my shooters, put opps in the ground
Don't post a song, cuz' right after you do I'll be taking it down
I guarantee iâ€™ll be the biggest reason you don't make it out
Take down his Instagram and YouTube page that's what Punchmade's about
I could care less about internet clout
I ended your career and had ******** come and shoot up your house
Let's hop on live and go rack for rack now
You signed for a million I made half busting packages down
It's obvious to see who's busting plays, and who's rapping for clout
It's obvious to see who really live what they rapping about
You pawned the watch, the chain and you sold your house
But that's okay come work for me I'll send you a route Come be a runner for Punchmade, I'll send you around
I can really teach you how to scam, come and pay that amount
