[Verse]
I'll delete the whole clique, fuck it scratch em' off the list
Delete his gram every time, there ain't no point in taking pics
I'll let them say what they want, but they can't lie like I ain't rich
My roster full of boujee hoes, you gotta fight to be my bitch
Catch a play at five o'clock, that's what it's like to be my bitch
Fifty K on VVS, it's nice to be my wrist
I got a jugg my DMs, like must be nice to really hit
I really **** somebody when they tried to hit a lick
I took a risk put on my team, you can see I'm clearly him
This is the yеar I'm going to make it out and plug my city in
I'm a living legend еvery time I step in Lexington
We the first to make it out we're going to keep flexing it
Staxks and Band0 in the whip, all my shooters came equipped
Been trying to tell them quit the street, but they just want to flip some shit
But I can't blame them, I'm still pressing fake pills and flipping it
I'm selling percs, moving bows, and I'm punching taking risk
My real life situation look like
GTA
You need some bows, meet me by the Kroger, what's your ETA?
You gotta shop for five or more I don't do petty plays
If you disrespect me you gon ***, I've been having my way
Every week I drive 5 hours to
Saks
, I'm a fiend
My foreign bitch love
Rick Owens
, my other one slide to Celine
Let's take a trip and pay for the expensive things
I mean let's take a trip, the three of us and swipe for everything
Both of my bitches keep fighting, they like
Tom and Jerry
Take out twenty-thousand from the bank I need a body buried
Thinking with your dick gon get you killed, I set the plot with Mary
If my shooter get booked I got a hunnid for his commissary
My girl don't want to hit the bank with me, she acting kind of scared
I'm rich in real life, when I pop out the public stop and stare
I can't wait to count my pockets at the end of the year
I can't quit cheese and count it up, what I made this year
