[Intro]
I was just playin', I was just playin', man, you feel me?
I just threw a geeker party, I just threw a geeker party
I just threw a geeker party, I just threw a
[Verse]
I just threw a geeker party for my fiends, come and grab a pill (Come on)
X pills and blue Percs, I'm throwing super deals
If it's your first time, it's free, I'm throwing super steals
I got "Long Live Heather" playing through the speakers so they know it's real (Rest in piss)
She's a dead bitch, but she still get my respect, she was a test kit (Okay)
It's a geeker party, all fiends overdose soon as they step in (Come on)
When I'm cookin' up a pill, fentanyl my best friend
I hate seeing bums walking down the street
The world would be a better place if everyone was rich with me
Be for real, twenty K is nowhere near a lot to me (Be for real)
You gotta have a Glock or Draco just to ride with me
Every time a fiend die, y'all should be super proud of me (Y'all should be proud)
We got too many bums around, I clear the crowd for free
My shooter's like Nikolas Cruz, he clear the crowd for free
If you died in Columbine, then you're nothing but a clown to meRest in peace to George Floyd, but what that got to do with me?Since when it did sound like a good idea to die over a seat? (Dumbass)Rosa Parks is just a ham if you ask me'Cause when I rode the bus, I still preferred to sit in that back seat (On God)
Yeah, it's like thatKill a fiend and brag about how you can't bring his life back
I got two hundred bullets in my car, don't get your life snatched
Snatch your family member off your neck, come get his life back
