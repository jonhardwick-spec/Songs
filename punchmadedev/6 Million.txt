[Intro]
(
Ayo, X9
)
[Chorus]
I don't never have to drop
100K is not a lot
I'm rich as hell, at the top
You're just poor, you're not an opp
I made six million dollars in a year, ain't try at all
They tried to put a stop to me, but I'm still glitchin', gettin' off
Y'all could never patch me, I been bustin' plays for years
It's lookin' like I'm in the clear
I'm pullin' scams and I'm still here
I be riskin' my career
Drop a check, then disappear
Blocked his Instagram, now I need another volunteer
[Verse]
Bring all the banks to me, bring all the Chases to me, I'm a fiend
Bring all the checks to me, bring all the dumps to me, and CVVs
Hop out the whip and walk down on the bank, I'm paid to hop on feet
When I touchеd my first mil', I put that on my team
I can get somebody killеd off of a—
My name hold weight, I can get you— just for a feat
Pull up receipts, I don't believe you made that money in a week
Let me see, let me flip your money, send it straight to me (Send it)
