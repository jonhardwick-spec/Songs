Y’all niggas know not to play with that gang
Pull up to his show and we snatching his chain
My niggas on go and we shooting with aim
My shooters gon' blow if you dissing my name
You don’t live what you rapping you telling them lies
That lil nigga snitching ain’t wanna do time
10k on his head that’s for crossing that line
He get hit up led I be toting that 9
I walk around slow cause the Glock in my pocket
Run down on that nigga ain’t doing no talking
They don’t want no beef they was begging to drop it
Lame niggas be hating I guess I’m the topic
[Verse 1]
I got full clips but ain’t shooting no movie
I just got a piece finna swipe me some Louis
You don’t got a strap how the fuck you gone shoot me
I jumped in streets and I copped me a toolie
Don’t sit like you with it get turned to a pack
Don’t slide with that nigga I heard he a rat
He don’t want no smoke he be running from that
Play hard on the net but we all know it’s cap
I hop on the net and I’m buying a piece
I stay with a puncher in the back of the seat
I ain’t buying that shit ima swipe it it’s free
I get what I want I don’t get what I need
I ain’t selling my soul I won’t change for a deal
Ima split with the gang when I touch me a mill
Y'all niggas be switching I thought y’all was real
Y’all niggas be fake so it’s fuck how he feel
Yo main bitch seen me and couldn't stay calm
She stay on my dick and I can’t get her off
Can’t fuck with the gang all my niggas on top
