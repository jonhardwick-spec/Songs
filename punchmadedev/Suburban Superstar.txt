[Intro]
You would not believe your eyes
If 10 million fireflies, lit up the world as I fell asleep
[Verse]
I'm a suburban superstar
But don't be stupid, I'll still pay the price to have them flip your car
I'm somewhere tucked inside the crib using a victim's card
Commit illegal crimes and act white I like to play it smart
I take five before I leave the crib
Then hop inside the whip, drive to the gate and type in 36That's the code to get out of my gateYou come from a dirty and poor family, so you won't relate
I had a silver fork and spoon you had a paper plate
The lease people knocking on y'alls door because the payment is late
I know you was begging them like "let me stay"
Both of your parents combined wouldn't add up to my pape' (Never)
A couple of years passed, and y'all still live in public housing
Posting 2K vids' every month I ran up six thousand (C'mon)
Since 8th grade I had plenty pape'
You're 24 years old and still take bitches out on petty dates
Let's talk about how much you made today
Never mind, I forgot it ain't Friday you don't get paid today
Real CEO I never had a job
I make my own pape, I never had to go outside and rob (Never)
But you was broke, so you had to rob
I never had a whip with keys, my first car came with a fob (Press start)
And I just copped a foreign whip, you still walking to work
If punching slow down, I promise you I'm back pressing up percs
Clock into work and go press up a shirt
If my city had a punching leaderboard, I'd probably be first
This year alone we put three in the dirt
I don't care, right after he die, go and shoot up the hearse (Come here)
