[Intro]
I hope the feds don't get this phone cause I got plenty plays in it
I made six figures in my home but I got plenty states to hit
Could tell you how inside a song but it's a ticket for that drip
I'm quick to end a dream chaser we got seven drakes equipped
[Verse 1]
Don't be surprised when you get tickled out that whip
If I don't have the switch attached then Imma double tape the clips
I blew twenty, twenty times before I touchеd twenty
I won't stop jugging or punching til' I'm up in Trump money (Nevеr)
And this is mine not a stimulus check
The wave died down but I'm still punching I need some respect
That cheap ass chain take it off show yo neck some respect
The city gettin' dangeorus I'm ridin' around with a vest and a Tec
I could make a quick ten In any state or city if you know somebody wit' a chase then tell em' get up with me
Don't try to run off with the play I got the blicky with me
Tear his back up I got the shotgun from Ricky with me (Rickyy)
I think I broke the money counter still ain't touch twenty today sit at the crib continue pouting (Twenty dollars)
I was talking about twenty dollars
I might be underage but I make more than my mom and father (Oh Jesus)
I could pay all of they bills at once
Went and got that shit tatted on me I know I'm the one
