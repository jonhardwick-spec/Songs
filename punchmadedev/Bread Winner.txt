[Intro]
OBN Dev!
Bitch, gang
[Chorus]
I can't name a nigga, that don't like me
Who ain't broke, I'mma walk in Neimann Marcus
Spend 3,000 on a coat
You got 300 in that picture, and yo' mama bought your clothes
I be big band spendin' this is Gucci on my toes
I'm a liar and a cheater
I ain't cuffin' on these hoes
If the promoter don't pay me I ain't comin' to that show
Got an embosser and a puncher wit' me
When I hit the road
I got a smile on my face
Every time I get a pro
[Verse 1]
Can you please get out the store?
We all know you can't afford it
You be lyin' in yo' raps that's why nobody gon' support it
All my clothes from outta country
I hope I don't get deported
I ain't beefin' with that nigga, everyday I spend his mortgage
