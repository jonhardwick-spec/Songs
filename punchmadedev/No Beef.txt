[Pre-Chorus]
I got blue hunnids in my pocket so the feds on my ass
Got drip and runnin' to that profit and securing the bag
I’m on a roll skippin' stage, flying up to first class
And I ain't beefing with you niggas if it ain’t ‘bout the cash
[Chorus]
And I don't beef over bitches so you can stop with that cappin'
I took you niggas went missin' before I made it off rappin'
I see 'em swishin' and plottin', I stuff them racks in the mattress
Don’t give a fuck with that thotty, you pussy boy, you can have it
They see I finally made it, they tryna get in my life
These niggas sayin’ I'm fakin’, they said he ain't movin' right
And I don't want no relations, I’m out here just givin' pipe
And we stay strapped like the navy, we keep them dicks like a dyke
[Verse 1]
Th-th-thirty clip up in that stick, we layin' niggas down
Just like a field trip, we sendin' niggas out of town
We gon' pull up on his block and spray a hunnid rounds
And we gon' call that nigga out just like he out of bounds
I ain't worried 'bout a ho, I'm chasin' big dreams
Just like an NBA player, I got big rings
I see my first ten bands when I was fifteen
That .30 heat a nigga up like he need sunscreen
