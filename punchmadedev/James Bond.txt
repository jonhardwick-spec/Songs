[Verse: OBN Dev]
I heard that lil diss in your song but it was all lies
Don't keep hyping that lil nigga up because he gon' die
Hit all that tough talking on the gram but you ain't gon' slide
[?] through your whip I watch it ghost ride
I might pull up with a different hoe but they're still both mine
Just put a upgrade on my favorite Glock it got a stock sign
Never had a nigga step on me you better stop lying
I never had a job but I got chicken like I'm Popeyes
I find that you've been lying in your raps no we can't do a song
Just punched up 11 iphones i'm tryna get em gone
This 26 gon put him on his feet don't matter if hе strong
You ratted on your niggas cause you thought that you was coming home
You putting on anothеr nigga's clothes you need to get your own
Never been the type to [?] but put it in the songs
Got big racks on me pockets looking like a graveyard
I'm a superstar outside my city I don't play hard
Broke without a card don't got a house i know your day hard
Them niggas hanging out the window shooting with an AR
I heard you got it in your songs but you ain't make [?]
I'm finna go and buy a brand new TEC [?] take mine
