[Intro]
Raise hell-ohh ohh
DevTakeFlight on the beat
Yeahhh
[Chorus: Lil Sace]
I'ma raise hell
Any shells
Where’s my ops?
'Dat bitch dirty cool
But she still soak me up
W-Watch me fuck a nigga up, if he touch my drugs
Knew your blush [?] knew that was never blood
That bitch on me, dog, you still askin' for a hug
She wan fuck my game, told bitch "hop up in the truck"
Beams flashing at yo eyes, now yo vision fucked
She been on the [?] you know it got me stuck
Crash that lil’ bug, man, [?]
Ridin' with them fuck niggas, you don't get no doubt
Knock em off the map, now I got all this gas
Pussy cannot feel me 'cause I'm always speakin' facts
He will fuck, nigga, get back, back, back
Yo breath stank you need a tic tac, tac
Absol is tryna catch me lack
[Chorus: Lil Sace]
Nigga go through that, I up my strap
I'ma raise hell
Any shells
Where's my ops?
’Dat bitch dirty cool
But she still soak me up
W-Watch me fuck a nigga up, if he touch my drugs
Knew your blush [?] that was never blood
