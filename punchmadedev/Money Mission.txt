[Intro]
Lot of money
[Chorus]
I'm on a money mission, I got like seven different money counters
Punched a mansion in the hills, I'm blowing Za, ashing on the counter
I got no regards for human life, I'm somewhere selling fake powder
I just cut a X pill with a Xan, that's an upper and a downer
I broke a Black in half and then I rolled it in my 'Wood
I bang thirty-six hunnid you gon' need a hall pass in my hood
When you get caught lacking without a strap don't call back to the hood
My Glock inside the front of the Tesla, I gotta pop the hood
[Verse 1]
I just had to pistol whip my mans cuz he dropped the 'Wood
20K just in firearms, we can drop the hood
Finessed a rappеr in the Punchmade, I'm the nеw age Suge
Put your hands down, I'm finna shoot, I don't believe in hooks
We got Swipe Stars and Pure Shooters, welcome to Punchmade
My fingers hurt from punching cards up, I got a bunch made
Knocking on the door like "Open up", this a Runtz raid
(knocking noise) I'm coming in like "Give me everything"
This bitch keep tryna start drama with me sent her to Jerry Springs
I'm well known for stolen credit cards, the bank scared of me
I'm five deep with a Draco, in the mall don't touch a hair on me
I drive 10 minutes to a gravesite every-time I take a pee
