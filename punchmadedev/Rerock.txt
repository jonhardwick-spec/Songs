(gang, flah, flah, gang, gang, gang)
Damn Jefe
[verse Punchmade dev]
Go tell your mama work for me I know her ass broke
Driven in that beat up ass car, listening to sad songs
Rapping like you made it but you still live in a trash home
You had first-class seats, and you ain't even bring the bag home
Flashing all those guns in your story like you gone' murder some
I wouldn't try to run in my crib cause I got plenty guns
Rerock him, make him send it twice like I can't get enough
Track him down, find out where he lives, since he won't give it up
[?] taking off in the scat, he finna drag race
I made 7k for a play, that's on a bad day
She came to suck my dick for day, left with a sad face
I got that dogshit on my page, leave niggas mad faced
[verse 2 Punchmade dev]
I'm getting sick of niggas saying I don't drop shit
Don't know if I should go and drop a check or go drop hits
We seen what happened to the last nigga who went dropped a diss
I warned them niggas not to beef with me, now I ain't dropping shit
Niggas they straight from the hood because it sound better
I could call you by your nickname, but I like clown better
I went and bought a drum for my Glock cause 50' rounds better
I'm really have fun with yo bitch she writing love letters
Don't make me pull this [?] out my pocket leave you standing there
I could really leave a nigga traumatized if you want take it there
I really been a cheater my whole life, ain't tryna play it fair
They know I'm from the state of Kentucky I brought the K in here
You don't like men cause I got more bread than your whole gang combined
Niggas snatching chains in this bitch, but ain't no taking mine
I had 30k as a youngin, don't gotta tell a lie
Hustling ain't one of your skills, you gotta fantasize
I'm a self-made nigga I ain't never had no handout
I don't look to these rap niggas, or be fanned out
Cause I really got that dogshit that they rap about
I'm finna be a multi-millionaire I just went and mapped it out
Niggas been down bad for a year still tryna trap it out
Do they really wanna go beef with me or go rap it out
Now I see him wanna rock with me, cause I'm rapping now
Made a quarter million this year and I ain't capping out (bitch)
(Broke ass nigga)
