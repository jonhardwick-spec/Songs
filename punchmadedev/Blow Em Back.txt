[Pre-Chorus:]
You would think it's Halloween the way I'm adding to my bag
Had them shooters at yo house, catch em layin' in that grass
Will teach a opp a lesson like a teacher teachin' class
Red dots to yo' window like we playin' laser tag
[Chorus:]
Niggas actin' tough until we pop out with that mop
If he really want that static, we 'gon make his body drop
Nigga, you ain't with the gang if you stay rockin' with the opps
We 'gon slide down, up the choppa, load the clip and wet his block
On my Ray Lewis shit  I'm dancin' when I get the sack
If a nigga talkin' down, we grab the stick and blow 'em back
And i'll never duck a opp unless he snitchin' like a rat
All my niggas carry guns so why you runnin' with a bat?
[Verse 1:]
He was talkin' tough until we pulled up with that stick
Bitch that chop stick got a kit, make his body do a flip
I've been hustlin', gettin' rich and I be stackin' up them chips
If he frontin' for them bitches we 'gon empty out the clip
Catch a opp in traffic, we 'gon send that pussy out
Heard he like to do the talkin' bet that choppa close his mouth
If that goofy hidin' out we 'gon run up in his house
Niggas in my lane, they better take a different route
How you talkin' all that shit but you be actin' like a fan?
When I caught him up in public, he ain't squared up, goofy ran
If that nigga drop a addy, we 'gon pull up in that van
And he best not come to Houston 'cuz I told his ass he banned
