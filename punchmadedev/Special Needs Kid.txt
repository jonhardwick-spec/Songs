(100 thousand ain't shit to me that's a lil' petty bag, [?])
[Verse]
500,000 ain't shit to me that's a lil' petty bagLeave my bitch and hit a different one, my lil' petty ass
I'm a superstar, cheat on my bitch and she can't be madLast year she watched me put a million dollars in my stash
She'll never leave, no matter what I do
I'm rich, it don't matter what I do
I threw 100 at her face and paid 300 for my food
I'm like a spoiled kid, everywhere I go, I act a fool
Yesterday I threw a fit because the store ain't have my sizе
I'm important, everything I touch in herе, I'm finna buy
I'm famous, they close down the store when I'm inside
You're a peasant, you can watch me shop in here, from outside (Peasant)
Ha, you're broke so you can't get in
I need special treatment, let me in the store with my blick in
I'm out of town splurging in the store with my rich friends
You better hope that we don't walk inside the one your bitch in (Come here)
I got a bitch for every state
And all of 'em gon' take a risk, I got a bitch for every play
I've been scratching off the list, I got a check for every day
I've been taking hella risks, I got a hit for every day
I jugg cancer patients, every time I see one I'ma smack his head (Come here)
I'ma jugg him 30 times before he's dead (G-Give me my money back)I can't understand a thing he said
Smack him, take his pills, then go sell them on the street insteadBut first, I gotta mix the pill with Fentanyl
We all hate seeing homeless bums, I can kill 'em all
Money's evil, so I'm helping you if i take it all
(Do I send it again?)
Yeah, send it all (Gimme that)
Retarded bitch, I need that
Watch me empty out somebody's bank with my feet back
I push a autistic kid on the floor, come get your seat back
I'ma jugg his ass, then celebrate 'cause he can't think fast
(Dumbass)
