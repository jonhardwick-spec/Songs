[Chorus]
Two seater with the top down I got the roof missing
Put a bulletproof helmet on my head, Im too smooth in it
The bouncer tried to kick me out the club cuz im too fitted
Or maybe cuz my shooter in the club tyrnna snatch a pendant
Go to the grave and play my diss song ima make them listen
Then kick the tombstone and piss on it, Ima make them feel it
We gon kidnap his son the next day and then take him to it (come here)
Have him right there sitting with his pops, I'ma tape him to it
If he alive th–µ next day, put a Draco to him
Today wasn't his lucky day the Draco was so hateful to him
