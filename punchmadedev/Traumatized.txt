[Chorus: OBN Dev]
He made a diss about my name I left him traumatized
In 2016 I was hacking niggas couldn't nobody hide
I just made a fake account took down his music and then watched him cry
I guess I really did us all a favor and took down the lies
Made another seven-thousand in a day this shit is getting boring
Made another twenty-three off EDD I feel like Michael Jordan
I can't go no where inside of Houston cause I got a warrant
If a nigga piss me off I wipe him off and he don't get no warning
[Verse 1: OBN Dev]
Sent bitcoin to my hacker he gon get you gone by the morning
They said I gotta quit now cause I've been still scamming every morning
I get a niggas mommas SSN and sell it on a forum
I done did a lot of dirt so when I'm rich I'm sliding out in foreign
Pay real close attention if you wanna beef with me
I can cause the same amount of pain with my laptop don't need the streets
Hacked all your music this fake signature gon clear up in a week
Rerouted all the royalties and now it all just comes to me
[Interlude: News Station]
The Department of Justice says a rapper who bragged in a music video
About getting rich from an unemployment scam is now facing federal charges "You gotta sell cocaine, I just file a claim"
[Verse 2: OBN Dev]
You gotta sell cocaine I just file claims them niggas really got caught with the scams we are not the same
I'm bussin checks for fifteen thousand dollars we are not the same
I walk out in my fit three thousand dollars we are not the same
You niggas go the whole year without no money I would feel ashamed
This a nine-hundred dollar white-tee no I can't get a stain
Some fifteen-thousand dollar bank play I'm finna end the game
Photoshopped my Venmo wallet and then make it look like he got paid (I ain't payin shit)
