[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy!
(Let's-a-go!)
[Chorus]
Bitch, I be ballin' like an athlete
Make a nigga run like he in a track meet
(
Vroom!
)
I'ma make sure the whole squad eat
Fifty bands stacked up in the backseat
(
In the backseat!
)
Connect with your bitch like WiFi
And finesse her brick, now they callin' me a bad guy (
Rrrr!
)
Cook your nigga up like french fries
I don't take drugs, but I'm still high (
Let's go!
)
I-I'll kill a nigga with a fucking spoon
[Verse]
Fuck skippin' states, I'm going to the moon
(
I'm outta here!
)
Goofy niggas using too much autotune
Take your mama out on a honeymoon (
Haha!
)
Spent thirty bands on my wrist, you spent thirty dollars on your bitch (
Fuck boy!
)
And I can't fuck with a snitch, 'cause these niggas hate 'cause I'm rich (
Gang!
)
Drinking lean out a sippy cup
Call the squad up, told them pick me up
Cut niggas off, and then run it up
Your wrist look like Mississippi mud (
Uh!
)
Like Playboi Carti, hide it in my sockI'ma Milly Rock when I'm on the block (Aye!)
Knock knock, who's there? I told that nigga I just wanna talk
Once he open up that door, I push that pussy nigga to the floor
Then stole everything out the drawer (gimme that!)The police waitin' outside, they said, "Lil Devo, say goodbye!"I said, "Fuck 12, fuck your whole squad!"And then shot that nigga in his thigh
