[Intro]
(Me, I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me)
(I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me)
(I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me)
(I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me)
I never knew it'd be th-
(I smoke it straight out the pack, uh, Thrax)
[Chorus]
I never knew it'd be this way
I never knew in just a year I'd have a million on my plate
I'm not you, I ain't somewhere hating, wishing I was paid
I'm not you, I don't have no rats or roaches where I stay
I'm really him, 5K is pointless, that's a petty play
I'm really him, I just hit a bitch then take her on a date
Exotic bitches on my plate, a couple more from out of state
I'm a rich asshole, I'ma always get my way
[Verse]
I just hit somebody favorite rapper bitch the other day
Don't believe me, I'll post a pic of her wearing my chain
If she fuck with you, I must be God, because I know you're lame
She gon' tell you no, but when she over here I get my way
Don't be mad at me, it ain't my fault yo' bitch playing my music
Don't be mad at me, cause when I come around she get to choosing
She gave me head wearin' my chain, I got a video to prove it
If my bitch don't let me fuck, then that's okay, her friend will do it
My bitch know she lucky, she gon' brag about me to her friends
Left her heart broken, but to me thats just another win
I can treat her how I want cause I'm a ten
She love the Cartier glasses, got her going off the lens
