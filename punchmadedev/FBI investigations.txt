[Chorus]
My face card scorching every month I be on Say Cheese
But I hardly ever rap Im just a pape fiend
No Jumper post me everyday they making fake beef
I jugged everybody on the show thats why they hate me
Go ahead, go tell the feds come take me
Im on Instagram flexing with the money that you gave me
It's right here look at it! I wanna thank you for the payment
And dont pretend like I ain't dox you, ill post it keep playin
[Verse 1]
And dont pretеnd that I ain't got it when you ain't close to what Im making
Look at my pocket, and lеts compare it to your savings
Keep playing, ima have somebody kill you for a payment
Keep playing, ima log into your bank account and take it (Give me that)
Its all fun and games until I leak your information
Maybe I should let the whole entire world know where you staying
I got paperwork to back up what im saying
Maybe I should let them know about that little girl you dating
My real life like GTA I dont pretend nor do I stage it
Your a faggot going on No Jumper and faking conversations (faggot)
You can say whatever you want watch how I play it
Ima have somebody wait outside the crib ready to spray it
