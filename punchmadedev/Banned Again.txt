Money transfer apps are an easy way to pay back friends or split the costs of billsBut don't let the convenience give way to complacency, that can happen on Cash AppsOne woman lost nearly $9,000 after more than a dozen transactions that really came out of nowhereShe called out [?] Kevin Kennedy for help
[Chorus]
CashApp banned my Phone again, I'm finna kill myself
(Kill myself)
Lately, I've been popping Percs and Xans, tryna heal myself
I went to sleep pissed off 'cause my payment failed (Pissed off)
I just might crash, blow up a bank, when they ban me from Zelle
When y'all see the CashApp owner die, just know I did it myself
(I did it)
No need to pay for them to clap Steve Jobs, I'ma kill him myself (C'mere, they banned me again)
When I catch the owner of Venmo, I'ma drill him myself (I'ma kill him)
[Verse]
Why would I go buy an SSN when I can steal it myself?
Just use the Telegram I made ****, I been feeling myself
I use my managers account to scam, then I send all the pape' to myself (Gimme that)
The clerks know my face card, I'm in and out the store
The neighbors think I'm trapping out the block, I'm in and out the door (Out the door)
I might be a low life criminal, but my pocket's low
I lied when I said, "I quit the trap", I just packed up a load (I lied)
Every time I leave L.A., I bring packages home
My crib looking like a starter guide, I got packs in my home (Zaza)
Threw a play to my mans, like I'm Patrick Mahome
You still ain't touch ten thousand dollars yet, go and tackle a loan (You're poor)
Or send your SSN details to me and I'll punch you a phone (I need it)
I think it's time for you to give up fraud, you still falling for clones
