[Intro]
Thank you, That is so sweet
Come on
[Chorus]
Lying to my head's like let me drop this check It's a win for win
I'm a fraud legend if you see me out, then let's go band 4 band
I would rather put my freedom on the line than work a ten to ten
Like zaza with a pistol in my pocket I'm so ignorant
I put my circle on the paper route, but they ain't sign a doll Just told my man that he could quit the trap but he ain't mind it all
We done took so many L's fucking with fraud now it's our time to ball
I'm the type to backdoor my own man's if you piss me off
[Verse]
They trying to knock me off my grind like some wrong with punching
Spent $7,000 on one fit I got a love for stuntin
That chain around your neck I snatched off you paid a dub for nothing
I walk in the strip, though five or more to club. Know how I'm coming?
I done touched 200K now everybody in my life changing.You can blame me for your brother's death. I paid a nice payment
When I'm pissed, I add more money on their head, that's why the price changed
I bet they die in less than 24 after they write a statement
My people say I gotta give the scams up sooner or later
I can't tell if they just looking out or some secretive haters
Duckin' hidin' from the IRS make a secret of papers
This bougie bitch been signing all my checks by the birkin the payer
