[Chorus: Punchmade Dev]
I'm the king of this scam shit, nigga, let's go (Let's go)
I been juggin' all day sippin' dirty Faygo
I can buy five chains and I still won't go broke (I can't)
I'm a well-known scammer, I gotta lay low (Law low)
You can run in my crib and say hi to the Draco (Fah-fah-fah, Draco)
When I touch down to Houston, I'm slidin' with Jraco (Boom, Dracos)
Put a bag on your head, you gon' die if I say so (Say so)
Better stay real close to your bitch 'cause I take hoes (Take hoes)
[Verse 1: Punchmade Dev]
I say the truth in these songs, never lied
I don't think you wanna beef 'cause I ain't stoppin' 'til you cry
Banned his Instagram account, he couldn't make it if he tried
I'm finna buy a new Glock with "OBN" on the side (Gang shit)
I got bags on my thighs like I play for the league
I been winnin' lately, they won't play for my team
You takе somethin' from me, get put on a tee (Fah, fah)
I got rich by mysеlf, no one put on for me
Unemployment burnt out, now these broke niggas panickin'He wore that 'fit for a week straight like a mannequin, damn (He's poor)
That sound like some broke shit
He wanna slide on me, but been on some ho shit
They say it's beef, but they never approach it
One play, you could get your identity stolen
Put the words on my arm because I know I'm chosen
You can fuck for the night, but can't stay to the mornin'
