[Intro]
[?]x3
[Chorus]
Backwood after Backwood every day
, I'm highly medicated
Fuck a college class, I went to
Telegram
for education (fuck college)
Deep inside the suburbs, you can't get here cause my section gated
Wired all the money out that bank, they gotta Section 8 it
I can work magic, I went from VPN to VIP
Don't put me in your song or Snapchat, cuz thats a RIP
You are not no real swiper if the only thing you hit was EDD
Snatch that family member of yo' neck and then I take a pee
[verse 1]
Don't slide down my block, we throwing bullets we ain't throwing rocks
Fiends knocking at thе door, I lied, here go anothеr rock
They will never know I put some fentanyl inside his crack rock
I told the bitch I love her off the drank, thats that Act' talk (I lied)
Punch after punch, I'm Mayweather when I'm in them stores
If the clerk looking suspicious I'ma drop the ID on the floor
The neighbors really think I got a tiger how the Hellcat roar
I got a lock on the drawer in my room, that's my credit card drawer
[verse 2]
You a grown ass man in your momma house, still doing chores
They ain't hit him in his head, they hit his leg, and his ACL tore
I promise my next crib gon' be a mansion, with marble floors
Sell P's or swipe cards, really I could do either or
I'ma have your family petrified when I find out they new location (they [?])
Drop a pen and drop a body, its sad your brother never made it
I paid 500 for this shrimp and lobster, I don't even wanna taste it
I was finna buy a buss down but I think I'd rather find a rapper and take it
Just stole my third bitch SSN you still paying for nails
I'm so quick to cut a bitch right out my life soon as she miss my mail
You a gangsta now? In Elementary you was a tattle-tale
Break his neck and then I break his body by throwing it on the rail
