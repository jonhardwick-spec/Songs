[Intro]
N-n-nine hundred degrees
C'mon
I threw a
Xan
(I smoke straight up pack)
[Verse]
I threw a xan inside my drink with every sip, I'm moving slow motion
I cut the lean with gasoline
I'm selling dirty potion
Walking sipping through the Lenox mall, we got our 30s pokin
I barely bring my shooters out of town, they always cause commotion
Don't put my name on paperwork, cause I'll clap a rodent
My opp want me to teach him how to punch the trap, ain't having motion
This groupy bitch been trying to trap me, so I packed the Trojan
She keep asking if her head was nice, I sent the trash emoji
My main bitch keep asking what I'm doing, I sent the
bag emoji
They call me every time they see him out the city track him for me
Here go a 20 ball, find him and clap him for me
That X6 can't save you you better pack a forty
Yes, bitch, I'm from the
suburbs
, but I got ghetto dreams
I'm trying to touch a million off of
fraud
, so I can feed the streets
My lawyer beat a hundred cases a year, there's no defeating me
The city know I'm rich now, I could tell by how they treating me
My hitman put a opp in the walker, he can't stand no more
We ain't never see you step on shit, going stand no more
He down bad Pillow talking, trying to take my whores
I can triple up on anything he got, I've been keeping up the score
I got three different killers in the whip, I've been ready for war
For me, my shooter catch bodies for free, but I'll pay him for sure
I sprint outside the crib, jump in the whip, when there's pape on the floor
Still got his main bitch over at my crib, she's been doing my chores
