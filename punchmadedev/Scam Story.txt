[Hook]
Just bought a dump, finna go and swipe
Go make me a band
I'm in the front, walkin' out the back
Fake cards in my hand
I'm finna run, 'cause my card declined
They know it's a scam
I hit the gas, I can't do no time
I'm not tryna get jammed
They on my ass, so I threw the phones
I can't see that cell
I check the maps
Now, I'm almost home
Still got phones for sale
I hit the road
Puncher in the whip
I hope they can't tell
I got the drop
On them iPhone 10's
I heard they sellin' well
