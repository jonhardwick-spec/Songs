[Intro]
Look out the window, I'm finna dump a hunnid out
Why would I go trap when I could
jugg
and make a hunnd thou'
I'm finna bac-
Punch me in
(I'm jus' playin', I'm jus' playin' man you feel me)
[Verse 1]
Drum on every Glock, I'm the bongo master
Red dot make my aim precise, better run way faster
He think that he going up, until we shoot him off that ladder
I'm thinking bout a plan like, "How can we kill em' faster?"
[Chorus]
Wallah, I'm tryna make the opps disappear
For every time they tried to play me, they gon drop a tear
This month alone I ran up fifty, I'm so top tier
Just because the money counter broke don't mean I'm stopping here
I guess like we finna act like we ain't see you walking out of Sears
Just because they cheap, that don't mean go wear em' all year
Dancing on your dead mans grave, Didn't you cry here?
They blew his brain on this one street, they left his mind here
[Verse 2]
If my card decline inside the store, I'ma play my role
Let me get this brand new
PS5
, and then I up and go
This like my seventh one today, I'm finna up the score
I'm road-running, once I touch twenty, then I'm coming home
We got our Glocks tucked
No NLE but I been hanging with top shottas
Stop playing like you crazy, we'll shoot you and your toddler
Erased him off this Earth he got to grow up with no father
Wake up and go work that shift
I'm prolly somewhere out of town, In store jamming chips
This my hidden talent, I can't show you how to work this bitch
But if you send over a thousand, I could make that flip
I heard the opps across town, I could make that trip
My shooter Staxk's a gun junkie, he'll take that stick
(And you can't get it back)
