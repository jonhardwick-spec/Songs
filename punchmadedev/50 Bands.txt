[Intro: DevTakeFlight]
DevTakeFlight on the Beat
Gang, bitch, aye
Gang, gang, gang, aye
Phew! gang, gang, aye, gang gang
50 bands in the back got the choppa in the front
Got it hanging out the side in case a nigga wanna stunt
Got a scope on the Glock incase a nigga wanna run
Diamond all around my neck
Jewelry shining like the sun
[Chorus: DevTakeFlight]
50 bands in the back got the choppa in the front (In the front)
Got it hanging out the side in case a nigga wanna stunt (Gang)
Got a scope on the Glock
In case a nigga wanna run (Bang, bang, bang)
Diamond all around my neck
Jewelry shining like the sun (VVS)
G-G-Gucci on my wallet
Louis belt on my waist (On my waist)
Keep a nine in the pocket
Make a nigga do the race! (Bitch)
How you claiming that you solid but you know that chain fake (huh?)
And I'll never duck a opp
Unless he talking to the jakes (Bitch)
B-bitch that's not bands, nigga that's five dollars (Nigga!)
Graduated from the streets, nigga I'm a street scholar (Aye!)
Jewelry shining in the sun
Diamond drip, splash, water (Gang, Gang)
Bitch finessing is my sport, bitch I think I need a offer (Aye)
Better duck when we hop out cuz' we spraying chop sticks (Bang)
The way we mop a nigga up we should call it mop sticks (Mop Sticks)
B-Boy you better lay low If you not with that hot shit
All that tweeting on the keyboard
Boy you need to stop it (Stop it nigga!)
