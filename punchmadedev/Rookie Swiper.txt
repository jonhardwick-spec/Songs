[Hook]
You will never see the bread that I make, and you a rookie (You a rookie)
Yo' mans in the party, with a shirt that say cookies (Lame)
Let a nigga start mean muggin' I'm gon' cook him (Cook him)
These nigga got to tellin' on my brother, so they booked him (Rat)
Free my nigga from the six, I know my brotha comin' home (He comin' home)
You really think that nigga tough?
We had that nigga runnin' home
I had to slow down with the puncher, they almost caught me with them phones
Take a look inside my pocket, yo' gon' see a bunch of clones
[Verse 1]
Nigga's 20 years old and still askin', who can match?
I already spent your money, please stop askin' for it back
I bought so many clothes, they know my real name when I'm in Saks
You can't see the numbers that I'm makin', 'cause yo' music trash
You ain't you shootin', you ain't swipin', or killin' that shit a lie
Ain't no nigga ever tried to rob me make it out alive
Everything I do illegal, all rats near me gotta die
This nigga curling up his toes, sharing shoes tryna look fly
[Hook]
You will never see the bread that I make, and you a rookie (You broke)
Yo' mans in the party, with a shirt that say cookies (Lame)
Let a nigga start mean muggin' I'm gon' cook him
These nigga got to tellin' on my brother, so they booked him (They booked him)
Free my nigga from the six, I know my brotha comin' home
You really think that nigga tough?
We had that nigga runnin' home (He runnin')
I had to slow down with the puncher, they almost caught me with them phones (Them phones)
Take a look inside my pocket, yo' gon' see a bunch of clones
