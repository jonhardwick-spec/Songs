I think I'm addicted to swipin'
As soon as I wake up
I load up my site, get a piece
You might think I pay for the clothes on my body
I really be swipin', designer for free
At the end of the day
When I count up my money
I touch 5 bands, then times it by 3
You thinkin' you makin' good money
I'm trappin' the money I make
You would not believe
[Verse]
Get a social, you can't use your own
Then go to Verizon, and cash out on phones
Sell 'em ASAP, don't be bringin' 'em home
You used to be broke, now you finna get on
It's easier if you go swipin' online
If your piece don't hit, it's a big waste of time
I act confused when I hear it decline
So the clerks don't think that I'm swipin', and lyin'
Y'all think I'm going too fast
So I'm slowin' it down
Your VPN gotta send you outta town
If you don't 'bout RDP X Socks5
Then you ain't a swiper
You just a real clown
Before you start swipin'
Go spoof on the address
It gotta be where they be livin' at now
So when you go swipin'
It looks like it's really just them, and you livin' inside of they house
If you ain't know that
It's ok, you still learnin'
You try to swipe too much at once, you gon' burn it
It's really free money, but you gotta earn it
I pray for my victims, I know they bank hurtin'
