[Intro]
(C'mon)
(I'm a rich bum I sit inside the crib-)
(I'm a rich bum I sit inside-)
[Chorus]
I'm a rich bum I sit inside the crib and run it up
Soon as I open up my eyes I instantly start punching up
If I was you I'd play it smart about that chain and give it up
I threw a 10 ball in the club I know you woulda picked that up
You might get get-off with the hoes but we can tell yo drip fake (Goddamn)
Did this bitch a hundred times and still ain't take her on a date
I got a button on the back and I still take it out to steak (Phew)
We bustin' plays on the road and I'm locked in won't make mistakes
I eat wagyu every day you can't afford half the plate (Phew)
I fell asleep cooking the slip the drank got mе half awake
Let's take a trip to Rolling Loud and plot out what wе finna take
Hell yeah I'm tryna do a song let's start on that today (Let's rock)
[Second Verse]
We bouncin' out the cut you love rappers that's a easy lick
Gon' take it off yo neck we turnt now we finna take a pic
Tired but snatching chains I'm in a bank taking shit
Yo music ass give it up, it's clear that you ain't making it
Put the right price up and call Rocky he gon' take the hit
Look at me I'm in somebody elses chain taking flicks
I never got rich overnight I was scamming, taking risks
I got a special up for Chase, they the ones who bought the kit
Come and bust a play with me, we wipe it down and then we split
Take off them dirty ass shoes and that 50 dollar fit
