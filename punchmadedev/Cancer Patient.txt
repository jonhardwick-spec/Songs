[Intro]
Come on
One hundred thousand ain't shit to me, that's a lil' petty bag
Hold on, that's a lil'—, one hundred thousand ain't—
[Verse]
One hundred thousand ain't shit to me, that's a lil' petty bag
Leave my bitch to make her beg for me with my lil' petty ass
I slime my bitch out every time my old one make me mad
I been droppin' twenty checks a day, I'm tryna pad the stats (Come on)
I touch a ten ball every day while sittin' on my ass
I could be rich for a hundred years just sittin' on my stash
A billion in the bank, another six hundred thousand in cash
Off my jewelry, I could probably buy a couple of houses with that (On God)
For pussy, you would probably go and pay a couple thousand for that
To conversate with me, you gotta pay a couple thousand for that
I'm tucked deep in the 'burbs inside a gate with a house in the back
(The shooting of Trayvon Martin, it seems like—)I protect my section, you get Trayvon Martin'd if you got a hood
I jugged a cancer patient, then he died, I rolled him in my wood
I took his petty-ass fundraiser, then spent it as I should (Give me that)
Revive his ass and jugg him twice, I really wish I could (Come on)
Learn how to scam, I know you wish you could
Come try and take a chain, I swear to God I really wish you would
Only headshots, I hope you duckin' good
I been slidin' with exotic Dracs, it got the Russian wood
I got a bank play at 6 a.m., I'm getting straight to it (Come on)
You can't relate to what I say 'cause I make pape' music
Behind the scenes, I get an opp killed when I put pape' to it (Come here)
If my shooter need a ****, I buy it and bring it straight to him (Here you go)
