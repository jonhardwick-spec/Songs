[Verse]
I copped me a piece, now I'm finna go swipe
Ten bands in my jeans, gotta keep me a pipe
Just scammed the whole family, they askin' to fight
Told bro I ain't get it 'til he sent it twice
I'm loadin' Bitcoin while I click on the site
I got MSR, that bitch readin' and write
I made twenty bands off scammin' the white
My Cash App got banned from scammin' all night
Load up GoFundMe and make a fake page
You better go listen, you finna get paid
Five bands in my pocket, that's just in one day
I'm sittin' at home while you work like a slave
Buy you a piece and go donate two hundred
And don't do it twice, or you'll end up with nothin'
When they ask for ID, then just go get your cousins
Do not use your own, 'cause you finna be runnin'
Please don't be stupid and go buy a debit
If you tryna make money, then go buy a credit
Once you buy you a card, then go find you a method
Or play all my music, I'm givin' free lessons
Drive far and go buy you a prepaid phone
Put a card in that shit and go send you a loan
Just throw it away before you make it home
'Cause the feds gon' be trackin' all over that phone
You need a puncher, a reader, and writer
If you don't have that shit, then you ain't a real swiper
If your internet's slow, then go buy you a fiber
If it's still runnin' slow, get a different provider
Punch you a card and go slide to the club
Dress like you got money, don't look like a scrub
Walk up to the ATM, pull out a dub
Then walk out that bitch like nothin' was up
If you wanna go back, then just go buy a wig
But don't be a goofy, go change up the fit
Do this three times, then you finna be lit
Your pockets was broke, now you talkin' your shit
Don't use a computer without VPN
You forget that step and you go to the pen'
You get caught with one swipe and you facin' all ten
But don't be afraid, just stay on all ten
Can't go in store, now you need you a runner
Somebody you trust not to blow all your cover
Y'all 'bout to be flexin' on niggas this summer
Y'all 'bout to be ballin' on niggas, No Jumper
