[Verse:]
If a nigga act tough, he get hit with that stick
We gon’ up with that choppa, make his body flip
Talk on that day, he get smoked like a zip
I can go like that, keep it right on my hip
Ni-niggas be talkin', they ain't ‘bout that action
Nobody fucked with me before I was rappin'
Said I was gon’ make it, they thought I was cappin'
I showed ‘em my song, they just started laughin'
M-me and Dav, we stay up on that block
Twitter talkin' gon’ get your ass popped
O-on the corner, I ain’t never gon’ stop
Got .22's, you gon’ get your ass shot
Instagram beef, you look like a ho
How you diss my dead homie then stay on the low?
We gon’ pull up with beams, put it right at yo’ nose
Don't know what it is, better act like you know
I stay in my lane, I get to the bag
Never did nothin' to you, don't know why you mad
They see I'm up next so they bring up the past
They wanna see me fail and that shit kinda sad
I ain't duckin' no action unless he a snitch
Only beef over money, never over a bitch
They ain’t gon’ fuck with you until you get rich
You don’t know who the real til you make a hit
It ain't bout the money then don't call my phone
They see I'm up next, they won't leave me alone
Nobody was there, got it all on my own
Always got to the bag, never needed a loan
A nigga will switch for a little bit of clout
I'm yellin' fuck fame while I'm up in that route
And if you act with it then just close your mouth
‘Cause we gon’ slide down, come and see what you ‘bout
I don't rap for myself, do this shit for my brothers
When I hit a mill, we gon’ be out that gutter
Stackin' my bread and then run up the numbers
You look out for me, we look out for each other
We in your block, ride around with them Tecs
A nigga talk down, he get hit in his neck
You only tough when you up on the net
You a broke boy, you ain’t ran up no tech
I'ma stay one hunnid and I'll never change
I just want the bread, don't fuck with the fame
These niggas be dissin', they all in my lane
I ain't goin' like that, he wanna snatch up my chain
Go-goofy niggas do this shit for the internet
On the Twitter talkin' beef, we ain't into that
All them beams, you don't know what you shootin' at
We gon slide, same place you be coolin' at
I keep them shooters layin' up in your grass
Like Nahmir, I got them Trues on my ass
Never was broke, always got to the cash
You ain't flexin' with diamonds, you flexin' with glass
Like elementary, we will put you in line
Make a dollar, always stay on my nine
Goofy niggas always wastin' my time
These niggas hatin', they don’t wanna me shine
All this sneak dissin’, they go end up missing
Fu-fu ass niggas, gotta keep my distance
I keep blue hunnids, I ball like the Pistons
Water whippin' while I'm up in the kitchen
Flexin' them guns while you up on the Snap
You say you was with it, you don't gotta cap
So I was confused so I heard you got slapped
You ran away, you weren't totin' that strap
I ain't been on shit but stayin' in my lane
But niggas still seem to mention my name
We gon’ slide down and treat you like a lame
Your shooters missin', they ain't got no aim
I'm makin' money while I'm in the road
Got all this Gucci from my head to toes
Got all these diamonds, it lookin' like snow
This straight off the dome, I ain't stealin' no flows
