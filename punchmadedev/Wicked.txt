[Intro]
I was just playing-
I was just playing man you feel me
The scam game wicked
[Verse 1: Punchmade Dev]
The scam game wicked every new week my method burning out
When I walk up to the counter my piece approved I never turn around
That EDD sauce had him turnt now he's back working now
Im rich now so I can drop a bag pay for a murder now
Them Punchmade members run the city we're who you heard about
They banned my face from every bank in town I used a workaround
This new method that I tried was green I had to write it down
Just paid a cut to every walmart worker that they got in town
I keep my MSR in good shape everyday I wipe it down
I bend bank accounts outta shape log in and wipe it out
He thought I wasn't him until I quickly typed his social out
I'm well known to take a credit card in my local town
I got more pape' than all of yall combined yeah I get bands alot
My shooter back come lurking with a K while playing Bandamont
I been running back and forth through different states with my atlanta thot
That rolex that you wearin ain't bussin you needa change that watch
[Verse 2: AK Bandamont]
Yeah I just went to flip a opp you betta change that block
I watched a nigga body drop I hit him in his top
I gotta watch the shit I say cause they'll tell the cops
[?]
I just hit a brick wit my bare hands and now I got a knot
This shit'll swipe for 30 iPhones straight but do you got a spot
I burnt a dog and now his flavor flave and I don't got a cop
I'm in the trap tryna step on a whole brick and I ain't got pox
My OG sent down with dogshit on 'em he look like pops
I just sold this bitch a ice cube thats a crack rock
I'm feeling good I'm finna take a bitch to black rock
And if I get mad I slide down to yo hood pull out a fat chop
You wacked them niggas whole hood we on the last opp
I just pack a punched a big chopstick we playin Black Ops
I told dev throw me a band so I can punch I'm tryna get a drop
They try and flick me on the road I'm finna kill a cop
But let me find an opp on the next block I'm finna leave him sorry
Hop out a nigga bushes with a chop and leave him in the garden
The last nigga survived a headshot now that boy retarded
They tried and did a line of shi the streets left me heartless
Shot him in his neck with a FN and his head departed
I got this one bitch who kinda dumb but her head the smartest
Bitches got mad and broke my phone cause I ain't kept a promise
I told you what it is from the day one atleast I kept it honest
