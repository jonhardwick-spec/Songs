[Chorus]
PayPal was never dead you just dont know the new steps
Blue Triple S's on my toes these expensive blue steps
Im trynna wipe somebody bank account, bypass the two-step
Dont disrespect Punchmade thats gon lead you straight to death
24 hours on a computer ima scam my ass to death
If they shut my site down, then im back to selling Meth
Spray it down with Fentanyl then let me Auntie take the test
If she die off onе hit I let my fiends take thе rest
[Verse]
I'll put your life at risk, do anything to get me rich
I need your Social
and your date of birth if you want to be my bitch
Here, take this check, go in the store and take a risk
She can't stay focused she keep lookin over at my wrist
I never needed EDD to go change my financial situation
If I need pape then ima take it
Straight blues in my pocket you won't hear no change shaking
Take off that fufu ass tennis chain you bought, it keeps on breaking
(phew)
Im a menace on the web, ban me from the internet
Its best for you to hide your Instagram, im known for ending that
(phew)
I'll delete it and make you disappear
I can really make a street nigga break down in tears
Im a different breed when I get behind my keyboard
Back in 2016 made 50k being an E-whore
I lied like we gon split it down the middle but ima keep more
You will never catch me beefing with a ham that wears jean shorts
