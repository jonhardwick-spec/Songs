[Intro]
Runnit
[Chorus]
I'm stressin' tryna make my legal money look legit
Fuck that, I'ma wear two watches on my wrists
You can work a hundred hours, I'ma take a hundred risks (On God)
Look at us, everybody got a chain, we super richThat's what's gon' happen if you ever reach for thisThe diamonds bustin' on this chain, you could barely read this bitch (Bustin')
I might pay using my chain and use the chipTo bust a credit card play, then grab my cup and take a sip (Easy)
[Verse]
I can sit back, run up ten without me tryin'
I can sit back, quit rapping, still be rich without me tryin'
Last year, I touched a million plus, and God could kill me if I'm lyin' (On god)
Let's see who could take a chain without them dyin' (Let's see)
It's okay if you ain't got it
It's okay if you ain't got a chain like us and you ain't poppin' (Peasant)
How come I never see you shoppin'?
All that hand-me-down designer, don't be lyin' like you copped it
That whole fit came from somebody else's closet
And it make it way worse, 'cause you got lint inside the pockets
Bring your bank account to me, I got some checks, I'm tryna drop it (Come on)
I'll up two hundred K on Instagram, who else can top it? (Who?)
Not you, I don't ever think you could
Someone come go rack for rack for me, I wish somebody would (Come on)
I keep my pole tucked, everywhere I go, I'm good
I grew up in the 'burbs, but I get love inside the hood
