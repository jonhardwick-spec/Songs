[Intro: BabyTron]
(ShittyBoyz, Dog $hit Militia, fuck a year)
(This our decade, this our century, this our millennium)
(Long live $cams, free unky)
I'm workin' magic like Expelliarmus
It's 2023, we fully switchin', ain't no semis cockin' (Brrt)
[Verse 1: TrDee &
BabyTron
]
Pull this bitch from deep, from the logo
Told this bitch I'm tryna get behind her like the PoPo
Mike Amiris with the rips and the stains look like a hobo (Shit)
Caught his ass goin' in the work, now he a no show
(Boom)
[Chorus: BabyTron &
TrDee
]
Unky in the kitchen with more ice than a igloo
He can't put in on, the spot slammin' like Jiu-jitsu
Ridin' hot as hell, 'cause I'm smokin' with my pistol
Used to care about you, now I'm happy, I don't miss you
(Brrt)
[Verse 2: BabyTron &
TrDee
]
I might put the shrooms in a time capsule (Brrt)
Thirty years later, go and take 'em
I might see God, (Shit) I might see Satan (Shit)
I might take a trip to outer space and see spaceship
Shit, shit, I might put a million in a time capsule (Shit)
I should've did that with some Act'
Used to skip 'em, now I'm tellin' bitches, "go and get some class"
I'm not switchin' like a bitch that ain't got no ass
I be droppin' dimes, droppin' jam (No cap)
I do what I want, livin' life just like the Sims
Pull up in that foreign, bet you that she hoppin' in
Really one of one, I do not have a twin
Really one of none, I swear these niggas don't compete (They don't)
You know the street's code, I wish he would've had his heat (Damn)
You know the street's code, I push the goose and cash 'em mink (Brrt)
I just cashed the buffs, arms white just like a sink
