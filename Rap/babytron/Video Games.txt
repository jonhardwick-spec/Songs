[Verse 1: StanWill]
Wu Zi Mu, unky buffed up walking 'round with stick
Apple orchard, hit the crib with a thousand bricks
He ain't SBDSM? I promise he ain't 'round the clique
Big roll, broke a thumb tryna count this shit
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
See a red light and run through it like it's San Andreas
So much shit in the Ksubi jeans, I think my pants an anus
(Shit, fuck, damn)
Hundred rounder, I ain't have to aim it
We gon' pull up, put you in a suit since your ass debating
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Hot as hell in my wife beater, feel like CJ
No cap, we turned the tables like a DJ
PUA balling, know you sick you blew that free pape'
Uncle's whip and then he had to take a lean break
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Tenpenny, Christian Loub's on me red and bluе
First night, quick to tell a bitch, "Put that head to use"
Doublе G's, LVs, I got X's too
Lil' brodie elegant, he finna swing the Lexus through
[Verse 5: BabyTron]
Finna complete the mission (Skrrt-skrrt)
Buffs on like Big Smoke, all I see is chicken
(Whew)
Riding 'round in that lowrider, I can't leave a witness (Brr)
Touchdown in Cali' by the Bay, all I see is bridges (Whew, whew)
We ain't even finished
