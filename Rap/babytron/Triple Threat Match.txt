Huh?
Huh
[Verse 1: Skilla Baby]
My big brother got lean in his cup
If the birdman stay on your head, better duck
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I got a big-body Benz
Full of beans in the trunk, OG called me unc'
Fuck hoes, run it up, huh?
Just made another bed for these papercuts, I hit eggs for lunch
My K came in clutch, I call that bitch Kobe, ayy
We've been ballin' all year, where our trophy at?
In 2020, I need money and diamonds
She think she got a D nigga 'cause he lyin'
He cop two, I gave him one on cosignment
If he try to run off, I'm gon' find him (Bah)
Four niggas ridin' with a chop, one driver
Out lookin' for the opps, we not 'cause they hidin'
Dog never played team sports, she play homis (Bah)
He never caught a football, he catch bodies
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Fruit Ninja with the chopper, I'll split his melon
And this bitch lift slow, send his shit to heaven
Balenciaga turban, I'ma Triple-S it (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Talkin' 'bout the plug, but we know you disconnected (Ha, ha)
The slug Mr. Blessings, I don't need a bitch (I don't)
Fuck punchin', hit Neimans with a Visa kick (Woo, woo)
You can't get power, that's that Dr. Evil shit (Ha)
White Mountain Dew, purple four on some Frieza shit (Ayy, ayy, purple pop)
In a different world, Super Saiyan, leveled up (Woo)
Loadin' up, grabbin' coins like it's Temple Run (Bitcoin)
Almost broke the crank tryna turn the pressure up
On the Wild West, came Scat with my weapon tucked
