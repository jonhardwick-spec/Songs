[Intro: MJPAID]
Let me just— (
My nigga Lee, I think we got another one
)
Tell you what's currently goin' on, right now
Tuh
[Verse 1: MJPAID]
This shit pokin' out my pockets, I can't even count it
Just in the studio right now, it's like a hundred thousand
The brokest niggas in the room always be the loudest
All these niggas is my sons, I should be the proudest
Out in Cali hot as fuck, you juggin' in the mountains
Gotta watch my back, shit, I'm always watchin' my surroundings
Don't talk that wave shit to me, I'm the one who found it
Niggas talkin' on my wave, I'm the founding father
[?] hop out with the stick like he Harry Potter
You tryna see me with no bank, bitch, don't even bother
Gucci shirt, flexin' on these niggas, I'ma pop my collar
[Verse 2: Fordio]
I can't write a book about them juggs, I ain't no author
Hear them pints callin' a nigga home, fuck around, have to dodge 'em
Bro can show you how to line a head but he ain't a barber
Cup be gettin' darker, bro see it what he park
Sick my niggas had to catch a case runnin' out of Target
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Had to leave her in the past, she ain't had nothin' to offer
Opened up my booking emails, it was nothin' but offers
Rollin' off a gram of shroomies, pass the cup of water
I'm the type, be beefin' with the plug just 'cause I fucked his daughter
If it ain't four figures, fuck that bubble coat
Moncler with Corduroy, look like I shovelled snow
Netflix and what? You mean fuck? I don't cuddle, ho
Bitch said I'm a clown, I must be, bitch, I juggle hoes
Ridin' around with the Joker, sellin'—, he juggle 'bows
BNB a mansion, when you use it, it be bungalows
Overdid the zotteroni, shit, I'm double blowed
Overdid the Stilpane, shit, I'm double throwed
