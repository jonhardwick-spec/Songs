[Verse 1: StanWill]
Bitch can't believe her eyes, yes, it's really me
BINs so fire, this shit really free
Tripping like I'm clumsy in the mall, oops, silly me
Dog shit stuffed in the pockets of my skinny jeans
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Ha-ha, I made ten before the afternoon
Tryna ride my wave? Like a pirate, let them cannons shoot
Sports mode activated, looking like Crash Bandicoot
Feel like Thor, it's Endgame when I bring them hammers through
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Having visions of success, I'm a fortune teller
We don't scrap, boy'll get popped like he Dr. Pepper
She don't sing but the dick make her a capella
I ain't Jay-Z but the stick get to rock a fella
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
I just dropped Kobe Bryant on an appetizer
Ghost Recon, that AR got some rapid fire
I was in yo baby mouth like a pacifier
I plan on shining for a while, better grab a visor
