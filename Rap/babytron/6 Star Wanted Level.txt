[Intro]
High as hell on Thanksgiving, eating— yeah
High as hell on—
Damn, Danny
[Verse 1]
High as hell on Thanksgiving, eating yams, sipping Wock'
Went from lil' dawg to walking 'round with the biggest knot
From a place where titi'll spend her last to get some rocks
Fully switch on it, you can't tell that this bitch a Glock
Every time I fell, I got up and went two times harder
Every time I lost, I sat back and thought two times smarter
Unky in the kitchen, he a chemist, making lines harder
Upgraded to them Demons, we don't really drive Chargers
But I might Scat Pack it, in a different tax bracket
One night OT, fucked around and Louis backpacked it
Profile crazy, finna go get jack active
Teamwork makes the dream work, tell yo' mans pass it
Banana Backwood, it's a opp in this bitch
Seen him out in traffic, fucked around and knocked him out the whip
Dub on my neck, watch by the brick
Five thousand dollar fit, to the socks, I'ma drip
Doors do that suicide shit, I'm hopping out the Tesla
Green Nike tech, cutter on me, popping out like Zelda
Can't do the Spirit, I'm too bougie, hopping off the Delta
Yo' mans down, fucked up, how you not gon' help him?
