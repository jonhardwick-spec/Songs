[Intro: 10kkev]
Fuck these niggas talking 'bout?
Talking 'bout I don't do this shit for real
Nigga got me fucked up
Look
[Verse 1: 10kkev]
Told her when we first met, this a short-term relationship
If you don't wanna die no time soon then don't make a diss
Built a fake website that look just like Make-A-Wish
So every time somebody donate, it go to me, you bitch
Ain't [?] when we talk about it private
Feds ask bro for statement, all he gave them was some silence
Red and white chain reactions, they remind me of some sirens
Yo sauce burnt out, now you tryna see who hiring
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I regret to fill out a job application
I just punched six jacks, I am not exaggerating
Cuff who? Bitch, you got a lot imagination
Amiris got the army print, I can't shop salvation
Huh, and if the clerk cool then I'm sliding for it
I'm in Cali tripping, dunking on the finest foreigns
I got 'em sick that I'm balling, Michael Jordan
Turn dawg to a fossil, I'ma dinosaur him
