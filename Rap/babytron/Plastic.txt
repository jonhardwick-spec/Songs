[Verse 1: BandGang Biggs]
Ayy, it go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Come to the trap dope banging, we gon' make you wait
Still get it out of state on this paper chase
It ain't no room for mistakes in this game we play
It ain't no room for mistakes so, bro, that's yo ass
Remember me when I was younger, always had the swag
Remember hitting dirty runners in a dirty trap
And my mama coming through the front, I kick 'em out the back
Ayy, remember walking up [?] to get a bag of Frooties
Ayy, you wanna get up in this game,we  treat you like a noobie
Ayy, how you tryna kill family for this shit like Stewie?
LV dripping off my tee, this shit came from Louis
[Chorus: BandGang Biggs]
Ayy, we be getting money, blowing through the bag
It go one, two, three, four, five, we on yo ass
In the Jeep high as hell off a eight, damn near crashed
Used to whip it up with [?], hit the road with the plastics, ayy
We be getting money, blowing through the bag
It go one, two, three, four, five, we on yo ass
In the Jeep high as hell off a eight, damn near crashed
Used to whip it up with [?], hit the road with the plastics, ayy
