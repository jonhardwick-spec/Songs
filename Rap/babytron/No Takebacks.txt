Hah, ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
So much drank in, I could fill the tub up and take a bath
I was tryna make a bag, you was tryna take a class
Pour a deuce then a deuce just to take a nap
When lil' cuddy take some shit, you can't take it back
On the road jacked up like I'm changin' flats
Three-striped joggy full of blues like I'm slangin' crack
Fell asleep off Wock', had a dream I found a crate of Act'
Why you beatin' 'round the bush? If it's up, say it's that
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
She know me from sellin' dope, she don't even think I rap
I hit that interstate and I don't even use no map
Unc' came missing side tooth and his lips were chapped
It's hard to gеt him off the dog, he on his fifth relapsе
You gon' get your head tap-tapped, he need a graduation hat, we call him Señor Cap
You lil' perpin'-ass dweeb, don't wanna hear you yap
I smoke Banana Thai leaf, but my eyes look Jap
I trap, I don't fill out apps
[Verse 3: YSR Gramz]
If I don't really fuck with you, I'm givin' out daps
You be scared to spend that little shit, gon' get it right back
Bro work at the Lids store, he be catchin' hats
Dog broke as hell, ain't got no car, he be catchin' cabs
Niggas tell the 'net what they doin', niggas AR-Ab'ing
What's-his-name was finna catch a headtap, but he too damn fast
Why the fuck you leave Saks with no bags?
Told Glock boy walk him down with no mask
