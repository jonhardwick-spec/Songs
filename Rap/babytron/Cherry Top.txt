[Chorus: TurkeyMan]
God forgive me for my sins
Cherry Top on the block, who they finna raid again?
When I was young, all I wanted was a brick and a Benz
(In the kitchen, learned how to cook crack as a kid)
God forgive me for my sins
Cherry Top on the block, who they finna raid again?
When I was young, all I wanted was a brick and a Benz
(In the kitchen, learned how to cook crack as a kid)
[Verse 1: MJPAID]
Gang
Turkey buyin' niggas out, I might buy a nigga BIN
Was swimmin' with the shark, I ain't even have no fins
Damn, Wocky is the potion, I'ma drop it and it blend
In Calabasas with the K, bitch, I'm feelin' like I'm Kim
Unky in the trap, that bitch jumpin' out the gym
I was never buyin' shit, I was punchin' all my kicks
Scored on some drank, bitch, I'm takin' off the lid
All these niggas is my sons, all thеse niggas is my kids
[Verse 2: Fordio]
For the Tris, it's six hundred just to sip
Rеally ain't no tellin' what we did with his bitch
Really ain't no tellin' what we did on the six
He was talkin' out his lips and got introduced to switch
Want to feed a juice checker and he good with the scripts
Bro had got his spoof checker every time he need to pen
Fell in love with the juice, it just start to take me in
She say she want the better side of me she'll never see again
