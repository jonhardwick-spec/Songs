[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy
My nigga Lee, we got another one
TYBG X SB? This bitch crazy
[Chorus: BabyTron]
The Based God and the Punch God?
Got LeBron in this clip, don't get dunked on
Better not break it, boy, you got one shot
Up now, charged up, I'm the plug now
Plug now, went from rock bottom to the source
Power Ranger, on a crotch rocket with a torch
Crab legs, you did top ramen off the fork
That bitch is not solid, boy, you're a fucking dork
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Talking crazy? I'll have bro put a curse on you
Bitch-ass lil' boy, should have a purse on you
If it's up, I'll have brodie drop a hearse on you
All it takes is a band, that's a verse on you
I could fuck that lil' slut 'cause the paper major
Like a stormtrooper, chop got a laser sprayer
Came rookie and the GOAT so they hate the player
Bitch thanked the Based God, just thank me later
I got thrust, bitch, it's turned on
Always knew I'll be a star since my first song
Lightweight but I swear the punch work strong
Getting head while I'm texting got me spelling words wrong
Stop saying we are cuz, we are not blood
Off-White swim trunks in a hot tub
Bro Ric Flair, he whip it till it lock up
I could hit yo bitch off the tech and the Crocs thrust
