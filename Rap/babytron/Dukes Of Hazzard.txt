[Intro]
(
Ooh, Sav killed it
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Yeezy 700 V3s on
Doing turn-arounds like I'm rocking VLONE
Jack man, remember hitting doggy with like three clones
STK tomahawk like fuck the t-bone
Tryna drop an opp when I spin, that’s why the seat low
Off the Turtle Pie, I can dunk it from the free throw
Three-five of— in the 'Wood, bitch, the weed strong
BabyTron, J1Hunnit, bitch, that's the cheat code
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
I’m from the South, nigga, this the Dukes of Hazzard, I'm Willie Nelson
Lately, they been callin' me the great, but my name ain't Welvin
Walkin' 'round your baby mama crib acting just like Melvin
Me and gang could bust down a pack, I ain't that selfish
I like foreign hoes that can dance, baby, roll your pelvis
The Glock make 'em shake, rattle, and roll, they call me Elvis
I really came from the underworld, they call me hellish
You gotta come and get the bag from me, I am not gon’ mail it
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Backpack Boyz, Larry Bird, I’m feeling like a Celtic
Two-thousand-dollar Christian Loubs 'cause the fabric velvet
Fuck a bulletproof vest, boy, I hope you got a helmet
Japanese Fanta, Wockiana, I’m exotic belching
Charged up, catch me hopping out the Tesla
L don't do the Spirit, first class, bitch, I'm doin' Delta
Bro took an L, we locked in, so I really felt it
Came royal flush, I just played the cards how they dealt ’em
