I'ma get them phones in the same day that they drop
We gon' turn around like yap, we got burners and them chops
You can try us if you want to but them bodies gon' get drop
Drop the top,
Wock' wrestle with the pop
There's homeless niggas on the streets, never mind, that's the opps
Woke up with a boner, never mind, that's the Glock
Opps homies slide down, never mind, they with the cops
Oh, he with the opps? Never mind, I'm finna grab the chop
I make a mess in the mall but they never mind
You flash money on the 'Gram but it's never yours
You don't even got a job, you still doing chores
Off a Perc' 10, cut into her, "Where's the coochie, whore?"
Aye, Tron, I'm finna start punching them cards, go and close the door
Fuck around and turn into a crawler if I pour a four
Fuck around and turn into a swiper when I'm in a store
Blow the torch, bitch, I'm in the cut like an open soreAnd this a big-ass Glock, I ain't got a swordAnd this a fucking Hellcat, I ain't got a Ford
I'ma leave a nigga wide open like a open door
Like a junkie on the street, when I get money, I still want some more
Funky-ass Dior cost eleven, that's a Klay ThompsonBoy, fuck yo chest and your leg, bitch, we face poppingPineapple Fanta with the, I'ma straight drop itLungs full of, boy, I swear this wedding cake toxic
Four years later and this nigga still clique hopping
We be in the streets, them niggas in the house TikToking
I'll up ten bands in yo face, I'd bet you stop talking
You ain't got no money in your safe and ain't shit in your wallet
I'll let the K rock 'em, boy, this bitch ain't 'bout itHow your bitch bad? Buddy boy, her toes ain't polishedFor a buck she'll let me slam but I ain't GiannisShe make the ugly face when she sucking so I hate watching
