Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do ’em like that?

[Verse]
You would think the sneaks educated with these big words
Leave him in the street with wings, turn him into Big Bird
Servin' ice by the scoop, you can call me Big Worm
I've been drivin’ straight for hours, I'm too high to hit turn
She say that lil' shit gon' do the job, I'm tryna clock in
Oh, shit, we gon' do an opp in
Shooter locked in, his main mission's leave 'em boxed in
Twenty on the floor at MGM, I pray the Sox win
I got a play in Garden City, gotta hit Venoy
I’ll let the chopper sing and make a hit, this bitch Kid Laroi
Thumbin’ hundreds make me happier than a lil' kid with toys
M-box 30s everywhere, you thinkin it’s a boy
It ain't the morning after Thanksgiving when I'm hittin' Troy
I told Danny hold the blicky, if they run up, hit the yoy
GlockBoy said he went Springfield in Illinois
In that warzone, the only thing is I ain’t get deployed
Shh, kill the noise
Told 'em hurry up and pull up while I'm still on Joy
Told the clerk to let me slide because my chip destroyed
You either hustle or you don't, you know you get the choice
Dipped into the whippits, all these bitches damn near switched my voice
Pulled up in that Supercharger 'Cat and now her kitten's moist
Banshee with the scope, I'm on the East lookin' at Livernois
You can't hide the dirt, even in mud, you know a pig gon' oink
I guess I need tobacco, I ain't really big on joints
Tabasco, I need extras with my chicken or I get annoyed
Shit, we just opened operation, come and get employed
Somewhere off of Warren, is it Iroquois or Iroquois?
This ain't rego-dego Cookie, copped a 'bow of Chips Ahoy
Yeah, I understand passin' important, but go get some points
You would think I'm five-foot-nine, I'm riding in the Royce
Serve your titi Coca-Cola, then I tell the bitch, "Enjoy"
Shh, what I say, bitch? Kill the noise
He'll get boinked reachin' for a chain, in here twistin' doinks
You could put a bitch on her feet
She'll still try to knock you off yours, that shit dumb, honestly
Like, ain't you proud of me? I'm a Prada fiend
Prada tee, Prada hat, Prada socks, Prada sneaks
Fulfilled the prophecy, you just a wannabe
My bitch scam and she go to school for cosmetology
You can cop a three, I dropped a colony
That's a whole pint, we in space on an odyssey
This ain't Monopoly
It ain't no card to leave jail, so if the cops on me, I bet it ain't no stoppin' me
Where's my apologies?
They said I wasn't the prodigy, but I gotta be, they broke as jokes, that's comedy
No-touch policy, the Act' a novelty
Told the drank plug to Wocky me, but not no collard greens
Fuck the quantity, I want quality
You would think I'm on a shoppin' spree, twenty on a tee
Heard he got spanked back at home, was probably on the beach
Heard he got to talkin' loose like it was probably on the beat
All these terabytes around this bitch, I'm Tronny Appleseed
Said he eatin' good around this bitch, was probably Applebee's
Heard they killed him in the alley, shit, he probably had to pee
Shit, he probably should've waited 'til he made it home
Only reason that my blood pumpin' 'cause I played the Chrome
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
Bitch, I'm heartless
