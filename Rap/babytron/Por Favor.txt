[Intro]
Undefined
Huh, ayy, huh, ayy
[Verse 1: Stanwill]
Wouldn't trip on a bitch if I was OT
He ain't make it to the ER, left him OV
All this Off-White on, I might OD
I done threw the white lows on, I got coke feet
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Forty-thousand on me, finna get a four for four
Spanish clerk and she cold, hit her with the por favor
Had the Glock up in school, you could catch me horsing dorks
.223s got the Holy Ghost, we'll send 'em towards the Lord
[Verse 3: Stanwill]
The opps, they'll never win, they the Clippers now
I just scammed a dumb white boy, I'm a nigga now?
They got him gassed up, huh, boy think he Hitler now
I just want the neck, old bitch think I miss her now
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
I was out in Cali tripping, fuck around, got sunburn
Cut into the lil' bitch like, "How the fuck that tongue work?"
Before I pay for the shit, I gotta try a punch first
Granny smacked the shit out me, I spent thirteen on one shirt
