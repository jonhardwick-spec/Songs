[Verse 1]
I'm a doggy at heart, might see me shapeshift
Bro don't got a job, he in the BTA biz
Called the plug up like, "What your ETA is?" (What?)
Outer space, rollin' on some BBA shit (Yoom)
Unc' Houdini with the rock, call him Bob Cousy (Hey)
Lil' ho got that WAP, yeah, that twat gooey
Geek kit unlocked, off the Wocky and the za, woozy
Think you Nino Brown 'til we detonatin' bombs, Pookie
Undisputed number one, you can't top-two me (Phew)
Pop out two chopsticks, now he chop suey
Hoes nowadays think they that 'cause they got booty
Check the leaderboards and you showed up the top goofy
Could've hit his drank with some piss, he a drop noobie
Why you introducе me to your bitch? We done shot moviеs (Hey)
The plug always on time, he gon' Ja Rule me
Dog woke up in Heaven like, "How I let Tron shoot me?"
