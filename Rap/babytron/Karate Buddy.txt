[Intro: KrispyLife Kidd]
Alright (
Enrgy made this one
)
What up, Tron?
KrispyLife
[Verse 1: KrispyLife Kidd]
You fuck with rats? You might as well be Stuart Little
Tron 'bout to do some bullshit and I'ma do it with him
You taxing and I'm cheap, just meet me in the middle
Picking up a hunnid racks, just me and Tizzle
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Dripping in my Mike Amiris, you might see my jeans drizzling
Cuz up the drum, fuck around and leave yo team crippled
Star player, get the shot off less than three dribbles
Surf and turf, need the biggest portion, I don't eat little
[Verse 3: KrispyLife Kidd]
Between me and bro, this like a thousand some carats
If Britney don't let me fuck, then I'ma hump Sharon
Shoot a nigga wedding day up like, "Boy, fuck marriage"
I'm all for the beef around this bitch like, "Fuck lеttuce"
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Try and square up? I'ma up weapon
Fivе thousand for the feature, triple for a punch lesson
Widebody with the V12, I can't come second
201 credit sold out, I had to come debit
