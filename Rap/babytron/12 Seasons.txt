[Intro: StanWill &

]
Reuel, stop playing with these niggas
Goddamn, Reuel, you tripped on this one, I ain't gon' lie
Yeah
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
All I need is twelve seasons, I'ma one up Bill Russell
Forty-eighth minute on the floor, I'ma still hustle
Scrawny-ass engine, boy, that V6 ain't real muscle
I could lose half of what I bought and I'ma still double
You can't bounce back when you fall, you a cue ball
If you down one, fuck a three, shoot the two-ball
All footwork got me scoring like it's foosball
Thinking you gon' keep up with us? We finna lose y'all
We finna take off
Cut the brakes off, all gas, shake the Jakes off
Unc' got that white shit that knockout like Jake Paul
[Verse 2: StanWill]
If the stick hit, it's game over, that's a eight-ball
Huh, I be thinking like, who made y'all?
Gang'll get you shot if you jump, we don't play ball
Watch the Black Rock sizzle when I take the steak off
Off his set with my 'migos then we take off
Bitch, I'm knowing you ain't smoking za, you just reggie bushing
Every single time I catch the opps, why they Reggie Bushing?
Could never give my heart away, the scams, they already took it
One eye open when I sleep, bitch, I'm Fetty looking
Two hundred punches, twenty BINs in my database
Thinking that he cuffing that cloth, I know yo baby ain't
Tron rolling up some tss tss, he finna play in space
