[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
Okay
Yeah, okay
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Pull up on me, got this one scam, you don't need credit
They won't check shit when I pull up Louis V stepping
Pull up, cut into the lil' bitch, ain't doing C-section
I can make a twenty easy off of two or three debits
We'll crop you out with the chopper, do a clean edit
I be wondering why I take them L's, bitch, you need lessons
Winter 2017, I got so many free X's
High as hell on the road, I had to backtrack three exits
[Verse 2: BandGang Biggs]
I need to DoorDash a pizza, let me call Tron
We in the studio blowed, bitch, we all fried
Catch you talking on the net'll get you [?]
RIP [?] ain't been the same since my dawg died
I got a condo out the way but you can't have the addy
I'm in this bitch getting cake, I ain't talking patty
Them three years on the bunk got me business savvy
Don't touch me if you see me out, bitch, you ain't gotta tap me
Ayy, or catch a bullet to your throat
Call you "red bottom", boy, yo blood dripping on the floor
If you tripping, let me know so I can trip with you
Young rich nigga but I got a big pistol
RIP Skinny, man, that boy was in a 9-11
But I ain't tripping 'cause he up there with the guys in Heaven
He sent some bullets in that work so he gon' die eventually
Now I think it's time for me to teach you boys a lesson
