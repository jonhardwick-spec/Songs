[Intro]
Yeah
That's a lay up too
Put a K up
What up, Helly?
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
[Verse 1]
Yesterday's price ain't today's price (Nah, for real, I swear)
Yesterday's price ain't today's price
Looking like a great white, this the BAPE life
Out the way, probably catch me underneath the stage lights
High as hell, thought I had propellers, finna take flight
We don't play right, the game dirty
Buffed up at LAX, I'm balling like I'm James Worthy
Put a hole up in his chest, his shit look like a Dame jersey
Dizzy thеn a bitch, I'm in the 'Cat spinning
Brodie trailing in the Catty, trust mе, he don't lack in it
No mas, unky caught contact, he crack whipping
If I don't do a feature, trust me, boy, them jacks shipping
High as hell, my eyes low
You was skipping class, I was skipping time zones
Going 160 off the 'Kiki, I don't drive slow (At all)
Heard he talking out his neck, I'm finna find bro
See him, let the pipe blow
See him, got a hunnid for him
They ain't think I touch them M's, I'm out her running towards 'em
Got the munchies, grab the reservation for some lunch at Morton's
Footlocker, Nike.com, I'm in here punching Jordans (Yeah)
Buying Number Nine or I'm off the creed from Himalayas
Lil' brodie in the Striker, if he see him, he gon' spray 'em (Shee)
Euphoria, the fiends on the block look like Zendaya
I heard they cut his time short 'cause he ain't have the time to pay 'em
Redid my kitchen, touch screen refrigerator in it
Told cuddy spend it while he can 'cause he can't take it with 'em
Bag season, that shit Pharrell, I bet I stay up in it
Heard I got the torch, I'm taking off, nah, I ain't playing with it (Play time over, I swear)
Full court shots feel like lay ups to me
You can't take a pendant even if you put a K up to me
Feeling bouncy, told TrDee to throw the play up to me
Why you out here chasing pussy?
Why you out here facing Cookie
?
It's 2022, bitch, it's all za
In my tech, money come to me, ain't gotta jog now
They used to put me on the bench, I'ma finna ball now
They use to put me to the left, I got the sauce now
Nah, I ain't lying, nah, I ain't trying
Ride around with Drac' and NPSs, nah, I ain't fighting (Nah)
Rap money, nah, I ain't swiping
In the mountains in my Stone Island, nah, I ain't hiking
