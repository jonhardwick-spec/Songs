[Verse 1: StanWill]
Hell nah, I ain't working on my right hook
First class bullets in this stick, get yo flight booked
On the block with it, I ain't throwing sky hooks
If it ain't the Fraud Bible, you ain't in the right book
[Verse 2: TrDee]
You must like Polo G 'cause you cap a lot
I ain't talking fight when I punch, I ain't gotta box
My bitch watch for FedEx, I ain't gotta watch
And, yes, I know it's our time, I don't need a watch
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Lying to these hoes, you can call me Simba
Juking like a Heisman, bitch, watch me spin 'em
It was thirty in this clip, now it's thirty in himHe ain't die, give him twelve more, James Worthy in 'em
[Verse 4: BandGang Lonnie Bands]
Ayy, watch me cook this old bitch, take her whole pension
Nigga, watch me rob yo favorite rapper, take his gold pendant
Huh, I'm the one make this scamming shit start trending
Huh, I'm the one smack the driver 'cause he ain't do the limit
[Verse 5: StanWill]
Fuck a mask, boy, my shooter go ape in BAPE
Scorching with the slides in store, boy, I'm eight for eight
Max stamina so don't pass me no Gatorade
Caught a opp, turned him Spider-Man, made him fade away
