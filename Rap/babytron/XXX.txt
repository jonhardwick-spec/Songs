[Verse 1]
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah, you better hit the ground
Tasmanian Devil, I hit her with the spin around
Cuddy taking hit after hit, he just might win Triple Crown
Shoes untied, off the shrooms, still won't trip about a ho
You got shrimp up in you, bro
You got wimp up in you, bro
Birdie with a thirty, don't you see it stickin' out my coat?
It's a button in my Goose, I'll flick it to that mode
Brodie dropped a Yacht Master off of shipping out them loads
Last time you had a twenty, Trump was giving out them loans
Testers hittin' like they Creed, junkies sniff 'em like cologne
We gon' sip it, we gon' pour, I ain't pickin' up the phone
When I was broke, they ain't let my calls ring
Before I comе down and get a bucket, tie my drawstrings
Out hеre aimin' at the sky, who you shootin' towards?
Out here cuffin' nats and writin' statements, where's yo' uniform?
Tell a bitch she can't get anything except a unicorn
XXX with yo' ho, we in here doin' porn
Shit, I made it through the storm, I give props to God
Triple-double every game, I'm like Oscar Rob'
Slide down, tap the trigger once, it's like fah-fah-fah
Lil' brodie glued his nuts on, he want a mobster job
(Yum) That's a lobster chomp
It's a boogie-woogie night, we posted where the monsters mob
This shit louder than a concert, let me put my 'Wood out
Boy, you the type to eat a glizzy miles from a cookout
Lil' brodie ride the scooter through the hood, he paid to look out
I told him make it here before them if he see the hook out
Pull up to the spot, still pain, Quag', Wocky, Tris
We got that, we got this, we got yeah, we got nah
This bitch hotter than
H-E-double-hockey-sticks
Scammin' flippin' scripts, found a yerk in the floppy disc
