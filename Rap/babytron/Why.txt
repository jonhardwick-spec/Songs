[Intro]
(
Fuck the fire, we got grease

(
Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby
)
[Chorus: AK Bandamont]
I'm posted on the South, one in the head, I'm gettin' 'caine gone
Why? 'Cause I'ma whack him if he play wrong
Why? 'Cause I got blicky on, it stay 'round me
I'm on the block, a switchy Glock, got mini chops, and I got Dracos
Bitch told me she love me, I said, "Why, 'cause I got pape' on me?"
I told her I'm outta town, might not come back, but she'll wait for me
Why? My name hot and I got state warrants
I got niggas in that field, but they don't play sports
I'm posted on the South, one in the head, I'm gettin' 'caine gone
Why? 'Cause I'ma whack him if he play wrong
Why? 'Cause I got blicky on, it stay 'round me
I'm on the block, a switchy Glock, got mini chops, and I got Dracos
Bitch told me she love me, I said, "Why, 'cause I got pape' on me?"
I told her I'm outta town, might not come back, but she'll wait for me
Why? My name hot and I got state warrants
I got niggas in that field, but they don't play sports
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Pull up shootin' circus shots like alright, we can play horse
Thought somebody got up in my pint, forgot it's eight poured
Quenchin' Quagy, boy, your baby smooth on the Akorn
Got banana clips, don't get curious, boy, you ain't George
Why you put the cuffs on that bitch? She a straight whore
Why they really down, actin' up, tryna fake score?
Why you sleepy off that Karo? That's a fake snore
At the door like your landlord, you better pay yours
Why you put the cuffs on that bitch? She a straight whore
Why they really down, actin' up, tryna fake score?
Why you sleepy off that Karo? That's a fake snore
At the door like your landlord, you better pay yours
Catch you slidin' in that ooter, we gon' flip the Kia
Then casually go to Coney just to get a chicken pita
This a million-dollar dick, I'm only stickin' it in divas
Fully-modded Hellkitty, catch me trippin', driftin' the cheetah
