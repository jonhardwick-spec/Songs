Hey, ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
Long live $cams, RIP Chris
T-double-H-L shit
Huh, hey
[Chorus]
Like GTA, dodgin' 12 or I'm runnin' lights
I told myself, "I gotta stack it for a hunnid nights"
You a store runner, go and grab some blunts and Sprites
Orange rango thing, brown guts, call it pumpkin spice
We don't do no itty-bitty skits, this a fuckin' heist
I don't know 'bout you, but I was taught keep it a hunnid twice
Yeah, I pulled up in the spaceship, your bitch got abducted
It's a Trizzy volcano, shit, the pop eruptin'
[Verse]
You can't tell me what to say, no, I am not a puppet
You know it's Selfridges every time I shop in London
Tryna step like this? Lil' boy, you be done got a bunion
The Za' done got me teary-eyed, you'd think I'm choppin' onions
The last one was fifty-somethin', but the next watch a hunnid
Why you askin' 'bout the price, like is you coppin' somethin'?
Why you lyin' on the 'gram? Lil' bro, you not my cousin
Every time the coach put me in, I gotta bucket
Boy, the crib big as hell, I hope you got a compass
Everybody just chattin', can y'all stop the ruckus?
RIP Kobe, crunch time, you know I'm Mamba clutchin'
Back to back in black trucks, you'd think that it's Obama comin'
This ain't a snow cone, this a Wocky slush
Cuddie slidin' Mase' truck like a hockey puck
Y'all can't fuck with DSM, y'all boys probably pup'
I ain't even give your tape a chance, that shit prolly sucks
A hunnid woods in rotation? Shit, that's probably us
Lil' brodie over did the Oxy', said his body numb
Preachin' like she real, fake ho got her body done
I can't tell yo' ass the final score, but shit, we prolly won
