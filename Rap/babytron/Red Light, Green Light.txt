[Intro]
"We'll be playing Red Light, Green Light""Green Light, Red Light"Ayo, Mark AOoh Shit, that's a Danny G beat
[Chorus: BabyTron,
TrDee
&
StanWill
]
Red Light, Green Light, don't let me catch you moving
Red eye, swing by, I barely pressed it, zooming
Unky in the kitchen with some dog, finna step into it
European sneaks on but the necklace Cuban
Opp froze up like it was red lightWhole gang lit, she like, "Damn, you know Stan, right?"This is not a Hanes white tee, get the brand rightSeen the shit coming like The Simpsons or a field mice
Green light on the Glock, you step? I'ma pop yo assI don't shoot no ones but TrDee? He'll rock yo assGang don't smoke Gorilla Glue, this Gelato GasGot her tryna dive out the Scat 'cause I drive so fast
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Green Adidas joggy, I ain't playing Squid Game
Unky got a script, told the doc' he got some hip pain
Jack run, fifty phones stacked by the sixth day
When I turn 'em all in, I'm copping big face
