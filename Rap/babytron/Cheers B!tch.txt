[Intro: TrDee]
Little nigga but my pockets
Yeah, okay
(
313 Mafia
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Little nigga but my pockets big bone
When I'm done fucking, one and done. she get sent home
Drop a opp in the pop, get him sipped on
I'm a ShittyBoy, you know I gotta put that shit on
Catch me outta town in a fast whip
With a couple racks on me and a bad bitch
Niggas really broke but they act rich
You can't get to that point if you don't stack shit
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Deep in yo bitch guts
I got pluses on my ass, Ksubis ripped up
Double G's on my hoodie, Gucci zipped up
SBDSM, bitch, we on some movie shit, huh
Closet full of geese and they all came from Canada
Fifth round with yo bitch, boy, she got some stamina
Gotta know you not shitting if you not a fan of us
Dog shit make the denim sag when I'm standing up
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Fuck around, put a dub on his top (Brr)
You can't sip, this is drugs in my pop (Damn)
You be acting like the plug but you not
See an opp, ARP make him run up the block
See an opp, hop out, throw him in the trunk
Bro caught a headshot, throw him in the blunt (Brr)
Shitty got some military aim
Little brodie like a Tide stick, hitting every stain
Only zaza when I'm hitting Mary Jane (Phew)
