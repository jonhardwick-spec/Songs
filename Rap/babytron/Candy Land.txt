[Verse 1: YN Jay]
You was sittin' in the crib with your kids, you the family man
I just pulled up with some doonies in a family van
Bitch want me to send her my location, we in Candy Land
I can't tell if she got a fat ass, she got on granny pants
I be walkin' 'round clutch like my daddy friend
Trippin' 'round this bitch, I just sold my friend granny Xans
I been out here servin' Billy, I got Mandy mad
Nigga thought he bought some molly, it's a sandy bag
[Verse 2: YSR Gramz]
Nigga, we got chops for the opps, we'll get on your ass
Man, these niggas out here stealin' flows, man, I'm oh so mad
When I lost my nigga Gabe-o, I was oh so sad
I could've graduated, but I didn't, said fuck that class
I don't fuck with these niggas, they be in thеy feelings
A nigga play with YN Jay, nigga, I'm gon' kill 'em
FN Five-seveN, .308'll knock down a building
You got a hundred-somethin' guns, boy, you not no killer
