[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Lil' bitch, I'm smoking Skittles, I can taste the rainbow
Xbox, ganked his dumbass, I done gave him halo
2016 Don C, naw, them ain't no Kangols
I done did his car so dirty, I should pay for MAACO
Your bitch made my legs weak, damn, my shit can't function
You was blowing up her phone? Buddy, I was face humping
Twenty-three shots in his chest, he LeBron James cousin
That lil' bitch keep looking at me, smell a "hey" coming
I ain't say nothing 'cause my 'Gram got a blue check
Ain't gotta save nothing, bitch, I scam, this a blue check
Smoking Runtz, Cookie Monster shit, blue Louis crewneck
Driveway, if it hit, fuck around and do the two-step
Mhm, verifying off of two steps
Why the fuck the Scat got more hammers than a tool shed?
Bitch, I'm big dripping, I'm the type to leave the pool drenched
If you catch me scrumble in my pockets, still don't need your two cents
Loose lips? Mmm-mmm, I'll smack a flame out you
Give a fuck if your granddad chillin', smack the cane off him
Give a fuck if your unky servin', I'll take his 'caine from him
Widebody 440, mm-hmm, I'll take the lane from 'em
Oh shit, Speed Racer, I do one-fifty
Knew the world was fucked up when I fucked her off of one giffy
He tried to run off on the ShittyBoyz, now he's the one shitty
Couldn't spin, my hip was fucked up, I did a one-sixty (Damn)
Hit him in his head, I knocked the noodles out him
Spooky-ass Glock got a body, spark the voodoo out him
He had that tough tone in his heart until we blew it out him
Driving through the mountains, features up, no, I can't do a thousand
