[Intro]
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beatIt's Lando your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, niggaOoh, it's BLUE STRIP baby
[Verse 1: Since99]
Metallic Green 4's on my feet, I'm steppin' slimy
High as hell, poured a four of wok in a blimey-limey
I'ma need two or three commas if they gon' sign me
In a hideout overseas, they cannot find me
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Three hundred black ops- mhm, fuck
Three hundred black ops out the bureau, these some bone crushers
In the stove or in the booth I'm a pro puncher
Four deep with them blowers on, it's like the Ghost Busters
[Verse 3: TrDee]
On the block with a bitch, it's a mouse in the house
I don't wanna hear shit, please show what you about
I don't care about the past, show me what you doin' now
Ain't no truce callin', sorry bro, we gotta shoot it out
[Verse 4: Since99]
Bitch, I'm with some shitters on the track, they toilet cloggers
Money longer than Manute Bol, my stacks are taller
I can show you triple out of Charlotte, Alonzo Mourning
Double back, run a ISO, I keep on scoring
