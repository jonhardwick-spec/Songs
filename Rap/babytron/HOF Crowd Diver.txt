[Intro: ScrumbleMan]
Yeah, bitch
Yeah, no cap
You know what the fuck goin' on
Yeah
[Verse 1: ScrumbleMan]
Tell the custos I need five for a 'bow
I ain't comin' out the booth, I need ten for a show
This a redeye, bitch, how the fuck I'm goin' slow? (Yup, yup, yeah)
This a redeye, bitch, how the fuck I'm goin' slow?
If you wasn't spinnin' blocks, then you can miss me with that bro
This that DSM shit, why they tryna steal our flow?
Since he thinkin' with his dick, we finna send his lil' ho
Crash in sports mode, I'm gettin' sturdy on a bitch
Heard it's fifteen on his roster, I'm puttin' fifty in the clip
Put a six up in the pop so it's dirty when I sip
When I catch you and your mans, I'ma turn you to a spliff
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Shit, me and turkey rollin' out the zip
This a pint with the plastic, I ain't pour it out a fifth
R.I.P. Hutch, all these VVs got me glowin' through the tint
When it came to giffies, you ain't have no motion like the Grinch
Catch an opp, blow his candles, leave him open like a gift
You can't go and pay your rent, but bet I throw it in the strip
Whitest Cartiers, it look like it's some lotion on the stitch
Shit get deep, I'll leave him in the ocean with the fish
How you wanna play it, doggy? (How?)
Let the feds come around, I'ma say this coffee
Used to play the shooter, now I'm wonderin' Wraith it cost
Sippin' all that green, I'ma think that you hang with Donkey (Ha)
