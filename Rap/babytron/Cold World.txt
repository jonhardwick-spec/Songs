[Intro: BabyTron]
These bitches loud as hell
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
Damn, Machu, why you have to do 'em like that?
Ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Burning rubber in the Chally when I skrrt around
Summer '19, was gifty trips and turn arounds
Every Glock you see me with come with a thirty round
Real life scammer, bitch, I do the shit you heard about
Bitch, bro Sprite got a dab of Wocky
Me and gang stepping through this bitch, we the Jabbawockeez
MIA scoring touchdowns, think our ass the Dolphins
Tryna grab the chain off my neck, you gon' grab a coffin
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Ayy, watch that backdoor, you might just see your mans running out
It's a cold world, you never know what niggas do for clout
Told her add me up, why the fuck the bitch start losing count?
Tables always turn, we the ones they used to talk about
Huh, chain got a couple colors, baby, come and see the water
The way that you hoes act, I pray that I don't have a daughter
Don't compare no niggas 'cause I swear to God my niggas harder
Young turnt nigga, I'm just looking for a Mrs. Parker
