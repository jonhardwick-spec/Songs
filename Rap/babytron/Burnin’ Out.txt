[Verse 1]
[?] in that Wraith, Shit, Let the curtains down
Finna' cut the traction off and get to skrrtin' round'
Catch me burnin' out (burnin' out, burnin' out, burnin' out)
[Pause]
Ayy

What's up Mark?
Pff, Pff
[Verse 2]
Ridin' round' not worried top of the two seater
Movin' like a mummy pourin' Wock in my two liter
Me and Mark in the booth, we just made two heaters
Need my ass beat five thou' just for two sneakers
On the court droppin' buckets on 'em we don't do bleachers
Catch 'em out like fuck a past, boy, I ain't a cool teacher
