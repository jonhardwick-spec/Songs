[Intro: BabyTron]
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
Tomorrow isn't promised, so I gotta give it my all
I ain't knockin' your hustle, just go and get it, my dog
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Tomorrow isn't promised, so I wake up and give it my all
I ain't knockin' your hustle, just go and get it, my dog
Wouldn't even try it 'cause he got the switch in his palm
Hand it over, took his kit, then took his shit to the pawn
Imagine hittin' a homer when they be pitchin' the ball
All the critics in the bleachers, I won't listen to y'all
Probably turn into a zombie 'cause we hit it with noir
All the drip that I'm droppin' got me swimmin' in sauce
Wake up and give it my all
I ain't knockin' your hustle, just go and get it, my dog
Wouldn't evеn try it 'cause he got the switch in his palm
Hand it ovеr, took his kit, then took his shit to the pawn
Imagine hittin' a homer when they be pitchin' the ball
All the critics in the bleachers, I won't listen to y'all
Probably turn into a zombie 'cause we hit it with noir
All the drip that I'm droppin' got me swimmin' in sauce
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Shit gotta be serious if I'm gettin' involved
Used to get the open shots, but you was missin' 'em all
You was brickin' 'em all, shit, you finished, my dog
I got stick in my drawers, let me finish this log
I'm tryna concentrate
Think that I'm attached to it, I need the juice to operate
Promise that it's not today
Ain't have time to drop an eight
Shit, I'm on the cranky side
You can bullshit with your bag, but I'ma make me mines
They know I'm goaty in that field, I'm on my Brady time
We ain't in no competition, you was born in '85
You could be my unc or somethin', with your old ass
Heard you told on your gang with your bold ass
You a 6ix9ine, Tekashi
If 12 try to flick me, I'ma get by with Masi'
Right through the coat, had to hipfire with Glocky (Brrt)
(Shitty Boyz, Dog Shit Militia, yeah)
