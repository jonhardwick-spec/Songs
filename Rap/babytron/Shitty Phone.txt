[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I just turned a Visa to a hunnid bands
And with a Visa, I can do a hunnid scams
If I hit a hunnid readers, that’s a hunnid jams
And if I make a hunnid posts, jugged a hunnid hams
Made a hunnid last year, Wilt Chamberlain
Blake Griffin in the pussy, I'll bang a bitch
And that little chain you got on some stainless shit
Bro Harden with the pot, he ain't making grits
Doing fire with the Visas like I'm Charmander
Goldberg self-scamming, I'm a card slammer
I can’t love you, lil' bitch, I’m a heart cracker
If he don't fall for the jugg, he's a smart bastard
[Verse 2: Lil House Phone]
Aye, you know I’m all about my chicken like some Popeyes
And my bitch got an eyepatch like Left Eye
They be like, “Damn, why this nigga get so damn fly?”
Reachin' for my chain, turn that nigga to a dead guy
I'm with Baby Tron, lil' nigga with a baby nine
Yo bitch a Civic and my bitch Mercedez fine
I’m in the cat transforming like I'm Megatron
My nigga say you trap, boy that's cap, we know you lyin’
Aye, I’m with Stan Will and you know he pullin' scams still
Man-made pills from a lab in the damn hills
Tell me how that feel, you can't even make a grand still
And I'm playin' with them drums like a band still
