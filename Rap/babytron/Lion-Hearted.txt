All this ice hanging off my neck can start an avalanche (Whew, whew, ice)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
All this ice hanging off my neck can start an avalanche
Sliding in designer head wraps, we the Taliban
Way before I had some bands, young dawg, I had a plan
Firebomb the whole block, shit get like Pakistan
Twisting 'round in that Urus thing, I might crash the Lamb' (Skrrt)
Huh, shit, so let me chill out (Whew)
I'm a baller, boy, you pay to sit up in the crowd
Hit after hit, shit, where the fuck my triple crown? (Where?)
Closet full of new season, it's somе drip around
Sick you still call yourself the plug and you can't flip a pound
I don't rock the Kеnzo no more, I'm still lion-hearted
I don't miss when I shoot, I don't know why you guarding
Pocket full of green dubs, bitch, I'm balling like the Spartans
Flying off the moonrock, me and gang high as Martians
[Verse 2: StanWill and
TrDee
]
Blue cheese and lettuce, got a salad in them Ksubi things
I bet all his friends die if ganger let the Uzi sing
Ghetto nigga, Glocky on my hip and let my jewelry hang
I just met the realest bitch, it's funny 'cause her booty ain't
I got big money, you got lil' pape'
Michigan heavy, you some lil' weight
Youngest nigga flexing, bitch, I'm Lil Tay
Mister Pop My Shit A Lot, it's fuck whoever feel a way
In the club mugging, ha-ha
It's funny they don't know I got my blick on me
Counting up a dub, thumbing, ha
I ain't use the money counter, it's for strips only
Looking like a porta-potty, all this shit on me
I be calling all my friends "Quan", I got rich homies
I don't trust 'em far as I can throw 'em, every bitch phony
Next year, I'm walking outta Hutch with a big trophy (Whew,
okay
)
