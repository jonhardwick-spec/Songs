[Intro]
(
Ooh, Sav killed it

[Verse]
Hall of Fame quick draw, he couldn't even grab his blick
In the booth eleven in the morning, on my rapper tip
Tripping while it's hazardous, I fucked around and crashed the whip
I know you in the crib mad as hell you can't stack a ten
Never sold a drug but I'ma tell unc' to tap me in
Dee brought two hoes to the room, I told him tag me in
Selling sauce dead, need ten for a half of BIN
Cheap bitch got her nails done, she been happy since
Bitch, I'm Sleeve Nash, even when I'm in a wife-beater
Dropping loads off, it look like Saks hit thе dry cleanersShe startеd sucking dick for no reason, she a mind readerPop full of Wockhardt but my bitch a wine drinkerCrackhead ran off, I damn near blew the blow out himAll-wheel drive on the foreign, could climb a snow mountainFell asleep getting head but I woke up Pro countingThinking he got power? .50 really bring the ghost out himCaught him drinking green and a shooter knocked the four out him
We caught him smoking Runtz, shot him up and knock the jokes out him
I could take the youngest baller out and bring the coach out him
My middle name "Active", I could run it up with no problem
I can take a pretty classy bitch and turn her to a slut
Cowabunga, on the dark web surfing with a punch
Told Dee put the steak down, he working up a gut
Apple jack breakfast but I'm finna turn 'em in by lunch
Bitch told me pull up on her then she got a lot to show
Amiris stuffed with cheese, Sauce God, got lasagna on me
I ain't bump my head in the club but got a nod up on me
Dipping with them chips, with my vatos making guacamole
My young dawgs screws loose, they riding 'round with chops and stollies
Gang dropped a pic, I'm in the caption probably dropping trophies
Bro off two fours, fade away and take the shot like Kobe
Looking at my wrist, I think it might be time to drop a Rollie
Balaclava
Carhartt
, pull up, make the car bark
Road running, you will never catch me in the car parked
Shooter BAPE'd up, fuck around and have a shark spark you
It's 2021, I need a interview from Nardwuar
Been chilling with the Visas, boy, I used to be a fiend to slide
Thinking in the summer I might see how that Demon ride
My east side bitch got fire head, she on demon time
You at the set with five hunnid, stay from the Neiman's side
Or, motherfucker, you gon' go broke
Cuz stomping on it barefoot, he got dope toes
You gon' need another wave, it's looking like yo boat slow
This bitch done got a couple gifts on me, she a throat GOAT
The buzzer just beeped and I been balling since the tip off
Left the money phone and came back to sixty missed calls
Walking in yo bitch crib rude, kicking kicks off
Using gang lingo? Fuck around and twist yo lips off
