[Intro]
I'm the youngest in charge
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Told them I'm the youngest in charge, huh, bitch, look (
A-A-A-Ayy Melly, what the fuck is this?
)
Bitch
[Verse 1]
I'm the youngest in charge
At the counter with the clerk, punching in cards
Wanted six figures, now I need a hunnid M's large
You can't make the first down, I'm coming ten yards
Think you fucking with the gang? You coming fent' bars
Boy, you know you laced
Talking 'bout you doing this and that but, boy, you know you ain't
He in here capping, all that hat, that shit ridiculous
Too much guala in the skinnies, couldn't fit the blick in it
(Damn, twenty-eight skinny)
5.56s with the green tips, feel like iayze
Leaving out the cleaners fresh to death, feel like Ace
Za smoke, burning in my eyes, feel like mace
This a V12 but I don't feel like racing
Ain't no bitches, dead Prezis what I feel like chasing
Out in Cali, all these flavors, shit, I feel like facing
It's some voodoo in our double cups, gang feel like Haitians, ha-ha
Every sip muddy, five percent wrapped around the whip off mirror tint buffies
Why the fuck when you get money people get funny?
Them dollar signs'll show their true colors
2022 ours, tell 'em pick a new summer
