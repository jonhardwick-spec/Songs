[Intro]
(
Meech

[Verse 1: T Bone]
Give a opp nightmares like I'm Freddy Krueger
I'm makin' money on my CPU and I got a couple users
Just took your bitch out and she pull my dick out
If I pull the chopper out, let's see who gon' throw a fist now
Doggie got a couple thousand thinkin' he a rich guy
How the fuck you don't got no money, but you get high?
Spend thirty on my VVS, you wearin' SIs
Chop bullets hit his body up, knocked out his insides
Doggie askin' did I fuck his bitch, I did it ten times
Even though this bitch fire, I'm still not gon' spend a dime
I'm gettin' money layin' down, bustin' down the time
I can hear his watch tick-tick-tickin', think it got a bomb
[Verse 2: Fordio]
Just pushed twice, I'm tryna push again before midnight
I find it crazy, if I don't sip a deuce, then I don't feel right
You niggas lazy, boy, get in the field, see what the risk like
Got used to the wrist, been in the field, I live a jugg life
Got out the mud and there's mud in my Sprite
Been on the run for a couple months, shit, all I know is swipe
I still get busy with the punch, but it's the drugs I fight
Run it up and put it up, hope you take my advice, you know?
