[Intro: BabyTron]
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah
Bitch, ayy (
What's cooking, Jack?
)
Huh, hey
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'm a psychopath
Lil' bitch pussy so crazy, she got psycho cat
MegaTron, I'm slidin' with the Drac', I'm in my micro bag
.223'll do the TKO, ain't finna fight your ass
[Verse 2: Certified Trapper]
This bitch'll make you do the fuckin' worm
Ten G's, nigga, that's your stash, thirty G's on my snatch outs, I said, "Fuck the perm"
Chase your ass down with this bitch, that'll make you swerve
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Douple cup so motherfuckin' dirty, think I taste some germs
Lil' bitch so motherfuckin' dumb, don't use her brain to learn
She an eater
Thumbin' through a hundred blues, it's double on my pinky finger
[Verse 4: Certified Trapper]
Bitch asked me why my pockets like a BBL
The way you ridin' niggas' dick, you need a
CDL
Shoot a hundred rounds out the Glocky, you can see the shells
