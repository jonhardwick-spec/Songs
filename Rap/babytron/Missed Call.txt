[Intro: BabyTron]
(
You stupid-ass lil' boy
)
Ayy, stupid-ass lil' boy, huh
What up, Stan? What up, Reese?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ShittyBoyz)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Rusty-ass boy need WD-40
Pockets fat as hell like I fuck with E-40
Jumped in the deep end, never seen Dory
Laying with a cold bitch drinking [?]
And the piece foreign, Visa from the Netherlands
This bitch got the demon head but she heaven-sent
GOAT DNA, bitch, you can't question it
Heavy-ass Triple S, I could press a brick
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Been a scammer since birth, I'm a shiesty fuck
You bought ninety pieces and declined off ninety numbers
Man, yo bitch? I'm most likely fucking
Real ShittyBoy, me and gang, we ride with plungеrs
That mean we got sticks around
360 on a bitch, I done spint hеr 'round
If it's up, bro'll make a opp hit the ground
She gon' go poof if you bring yo bitch around
