Part I: "Legendary"
[Verse]
Free Ri', what brodie did, that shit was legendary
Poured an eight in January, I was sleep 'til February
Pretty bitch, she look too nice, but the head was scary
Three-five after three-five like it's necessary
Huh, you a rookie, this the last level
Going two hundred, I'm in here standing on the gas pedal
Seven thousand on the verse and I'll make the track special (No cap, no cap)
This a Lamborghini Urus, fuck that 'RT
Riding 'round with that big load, I need a RV
Finna charge up like Bardock, I'm off a RP
You ain't got no pape', boy, you shouldn't start beef
Go and check his heartbeat (Shit)
So much papеr in these Ksubi jeans, you'd think I printеd it (Fuck)
Why he tryna have a money fight? This shit unlimited (Brr)
Full court shot, I'm hitting it, the range limitless
Would've thought that unky cooking sugar with the cinnamon (Whew, whew)
Good goose coat, check the feathers, you ain't fly as me
Turtle Pie, unreleased strain, you ain't high as me (Whew)
You be in the jungle hiding out, I'm where lions be
Turn him to a Call of Duty crawler if he tryna flee (Fuck)
Online, everything I see, that shit kinda free (Shit)
Spent your whole lil' life savings on this diamond link (Damn)
SBDSM, we the shit, ain't no I in team (Yeah)
Spent so much on these damn kicks, think I'm buying feet (Whew)
