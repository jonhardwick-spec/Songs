[Verse 1: StanWill]
Ayy, thou' on the kicks (Thou'), slides with the chip (Yeah)
Feel like Wayne Gretzky, I'ma slide with the stick (Rraow)
I just left Enterprise and threw some miles on the whip (Skrrt, skrrt)
I just hit twenty Apples, could build a house with these bricks, ayy (Jacks)
[Verse 2: Lil Blade]
Just did a turn-around, could buy a house off this trip (Yup)
If the city too hot, I hit the South with this shit (I'm gone)
50K in ice with a Glock on my hip (Nigga)
Try to reach for my neck and you get popped in your shit, nigga (Boom)
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Yeah, okay, yum yum sauce, garlic butter, lobster with the steak
Real star, 2021, I'm droppin' me a Wraith (Real star)
Shoot him in his back, walk him down, pop him in his face
Big 'bows, get 'em flew in, ain't coppin' me no eighths
Man, who the fuck is that? Stan, grab the K
I'm with Cam and Blade, high as hell, I just slammed an eight
Sleeve Nash, I ain't gotta score, I can pass the play
Dunkin' 201s, type of shit to make the basket break (Yop)
