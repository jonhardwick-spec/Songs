[Intro: Bankroll Reese]
What up, Stan?
Yeah, what up, Tron?
Ayy, ayy (
Damn, JakeSand
)
[Verse 1: Bankroll Reese]
Yeah, the Presi' full of boogers like Trump wiped his nose on it
He was talking slick out his neck so I [?] on him
Face card good with the plug, never stole from him
Sent that nigga straight up to God, I'm a soul donor
If this bitch take a pic, I'ma Stone Cold her
Got to living in her walls, I'm a home owner
Yeah, I feel like Jaiswan, got the cold shoulder
I hit that bitch like a dog, told her roll over
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
You cannot be a gang, you are not Shitty
Throw that bitch up to Reese, boy, that's Lob City
Can you with the sauce? Boy, are the opps litty?
Uncle Drew with the chop, I'll drop fifty
Chase my exotics with еssential water
ShittyBoyz, bitch, the wholе gang step regardless
Jumped in the deep end, end up next to Marlin
Go to war with us? You gon' need some extra armor
[Verse 3: StanWill]
I'll have bro draw the chop, he a sketch artist
Looking like I punt paint brushes, I'm a step artist
Might rock a lil' Comme des but my chest heartless
If my mans got that sack on him, I'ma left guard him
Let me scrumble 'round for a fuck to give
You could be a pedophile and you couldn't touch the kid
Jugged a ham and went to brunch at ten
Jumped in the deep end and I came up with fins
