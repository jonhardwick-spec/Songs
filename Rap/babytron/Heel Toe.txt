[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Told him meet me in the 'burbs, 75 to John R
I ain't never served soft, I ain't never cop hard
I'm a fraud star, when cuddy working in that kitchen, you hear dogs bark
Blender plugged in, with that work, he an all-star
My pockets Paul Blart, I'll hit the 'Set and get to shopping 'til the mall's dark
[Verse 2: PrinceÂ Jefe]
I put the bag in your hands, up to you to move it
Me and Lil C hop out with switchy tryna make a movie
I ain't no role model, sip drank, sell dope to users
We beat the road down, abuse it more than music
Can't let them niggas get the lead, they'll still blow it
I'm two-stepping on the dope, I get the heel to 'em
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
This lil' change up in my pocket, don't get killed for it
A couple up like Peezy, best believe the third mil' loading
All my shooters see is red, put them bulls on you
Know a scammer that'd catch a body, put some fulls on you
All your marbles in one basket, you a fool, ain't you?
Got to drive around in Pop's whip, you feeling cool, ain't you?
