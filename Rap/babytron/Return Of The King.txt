[Intro]
(
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse]
I don't know why the fuck he ran off
Five make him disappear with the stick like Gandalf
He been hiding, shit, it's been a year
In that Dodge Viper stick shift, catch me switching gears (Ooh)
White sticks on, looking like the Pale Orc
Heard the wave rider south, I'm finna sail north
Frodo with the ring on my mission, heard you failed yours
Right behind him, treat him like a 'Wood and get his tail torched
Pendant big as hell, it's hanging, looking like the Arkenstone
Shooter laying in yo lawn, he looking like a garden gnome (Shit)
Whoevеr think they king, you better guard yo thronе
Leopard print Amiris, white lows, and a heart of Chrome
Why you out here getting high? Yo money shorter than a hobbit
You just bought a zip of reggie, cost a quarter and some toxic
You don't really want no beef, the type to order with no topping
She ain't looking up, shit, I might record her while she top me
Eyes on you everywhere you go, I'm like Sauron
Man, get yo bitch-ass on the bench 'fore you get scored on
Fucking moron (Ha-ha)
If you don't leave your porch, I'ma shoot him through the doorknob
Bitch'll never get a ring, Gollum
See him out enough to beam,
Gollum
Popped him, shot him, shit, we done dropped him
So many flavors, mix matching shit, I got options
I got two pocket rockets, Mary and Pippen
It's time to put that ten down, boy, that's barely some chicken
The motherfuckers always talking the scariest ending
Shawty better not try to run off with it, I'm burying bitches
This a Track', not a trail, not a Cherokee
I got aqua on my neck so bitches stare at me
I'll pull up in that Lamb' like I'm Jeremy
I'ma hustle as long as there's some air in me
You ain't the plug, you got man in the middle work
Ride around, horses in my hood like it's Middle Earth
Ride around with little Uzi in the vert'
Save her as Rihanna, finna put this lil' bitch to work
When gang shoot, they don't miss, they like elves
Doggy ask a hunnid sum' questions, acting like 12
I'll catch a sale by jail
Talk shit eleven-thirty? Catch a shell by twelve
Bitch, I'm war ready, hope you on the same shit
We gon' sweep 'em out the series, they won't see a game six
Talking shit up in the booth, they need to fireproof it
Back on my scam shit, this slider music
You'll switch on your side, you're like Saruman
Lil' brodie slimy, he grimy, he do more than rob
High as hell off this drank, I might soar to God
Let your bitch see this kit, she gon' more than slob
Opps cliquing up, I'm sick they out here fellowshipping
I'm off red, I'm off purple, you be yellow sipping
Punch, punch, shit, damn, I'm like Canelo with it
Three-seven in the Backwood, you be rello hitting
On the chill side of things, Palm Angels joggy
I done seen his affidavit, I can't hang with doggy
Told the cop, "It's not drank, it's coffee"
Feel like Sidney, got the stick, shit, I play like Crosby
Stand over him and watch his soul leave his body
Pray that I don't crash, I'm off the Wocky tryna swing the Masi'
Got a great lawyer, I could probably beat a homi'
I just want a Faygo with some lean, you can keep the Jollys
One man army but I stand on ten toes
This some Helmut Lang, this is not no Kenzo
Catch it one handed then I dance up in the endzone
7.62s hit him, where the fuck his flesh go?
Boy, yo bitch, you need to check her, I be chess moving
Half-court, hit the shot, you thought that it was Steph shooting
Shit, we up right now, y'all ain't even next, stupid
Was like, "Fuck school", when I went was on my desk drooling
They already know the vibe, we in here test tubing
If the rap or the scam don't work, I bet the 'Rex do it
He better sit the fuck back and watch how the best do it
G-O-A-T vibes
Got 'em sick, heard they hate me now
The booth burning up, turn the fucking AC on
