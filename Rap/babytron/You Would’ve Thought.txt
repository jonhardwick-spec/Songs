Yeah, huh
You would've probably thought, he would've probably thought
You would've thought, you would've thought
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Would've thought I had woodshop, I was bringing tools into school
Chillin' with your bitch, gettin' blew like a fuse
You gon' lose tryna do what I do
You got a better chance finding drool in a pool
Fuck being even, I'm tryna take the lead
Thirty 'bows of zaza nugs, ain't no shake in these
Mad that I'm fly, it ain't my fault God gave me wings
Wake up clutching, I been having some crazy dreams
Touchdown and score a bucket, I play two sports
Backwoods and Throwbacks, ain't no Newports
Rolling loud at Rolling Loud up in New York
Catch him out of bounds and blow the whistle like I'm Too $hort
I can move the bag chilling, telekinesis
Walk up on the lot like, "Y'all selling the Demon?"
If I was down there in my kit, then Hell'd be freezing
Caught an opp out, he copped a plea, told him, "Tell it to Jesus"
