Ayo, Mark A

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
On the ping side of things, I jammed and slid today (Ping)
You cannot name a single opp that slid this way
I'ma let this bitch bang, ain't got time to instigate
I just pulled three of a hitter, that's a triple play
Pull up roadside and fix the problem like I'm AAA
Hammer on me, come down and swing it like I'm Triple-H
Everything heavy, bro, you livin' like a middle ways
[Verse 2: MJPAID]
Fans suckin' dick or ain't no bank, bitch can get away
Me and Tron in stores, he on tour, he finna miss a day
Bitches made in style, you should put this in a picture frame
Shifty in the crib, niggas think I fuck with real estate
Brodie, he can't scam, so he fuckin' with the intеrstate
(Was just sippin' red yestеrday, lame)
Shit, shit is not for losers, lil' nigga, it's a [?] game (Shit)
Drop a three of that red like my name Dwayne (Shit)
When I'm up, I don't change, I remain the same
[Verse 3: $camaurion]
Your bitch playin' follow her name, she get sent away
Smokin' asteroids on some shit, feelin' sent to space
Why you smokin' dutches? That shit leave you with the swisher taste (Lame)
I crack cards, I crack safes, I'll hit up Chase
Jefe off a half bar, he can't feel his face
I just popped a hell thirty, feel like Steph and Klay (Yeah)
Drop a deuce of Quag, all I sip is straight
Know how to make my own wave, niggas imitate
