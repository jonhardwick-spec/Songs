[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Plug said it's footballs around, I told him throw a spiral
Scratched off on 12, they thought that I was finna show the title
Stomp him out and post the vid, he sick he goin' viral
[Verse 2:
$camaurion
]
We gon' slide OT, they meet us on arrival
All my opps broke as fuck, I don't got no rivals (Nah)
Boy, your sauce runnin' out, you need a scam revival
Marcelo Burlon tee on, bitch, I'm feelin' tribal
Hit the road every day, ain't even have no license
Ain't no callin' my jugg phone, bitch, you gotta Skype me
Got a site that piece so fast that bitch hit like lightnin'
(Boy, the way that I punch shit, you would think I'm fightin')
'018, no ATT? I go and hit Verizon
[Verse 3: JuSleaze]
'Bows comin' straight through FedEx, we finna overnight 'em
Don't talk about my ex, that bitch dead, man, these hoes is triflin'
In the cockpit takin' differеnt drugs like I know the pilot
(I catch an opp walkin' out the crib, I'ma havе to snipe him)
Put an opp nigga on a t-shirt, we finna advertise him
7.62's comin' out the Drac', look like Oscar Mayers
Doin' donuts in the Redeye, I done popped the tires
(Thirty dot on me goin' through at Walmart, I don't shop at Meijers)
