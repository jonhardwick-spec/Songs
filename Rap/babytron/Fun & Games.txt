[Verse 1: StanWill]
Bet I put him on the ground if it's beef, for that cheese, knock his taco off
Ball a fist around gang, bet a shot go off
If you let him, he'll backdoor you, better watch your dog
Balls hangin' off the chop, it ain't got no drawers
R.I.P. Hutch, second chain on the way
We done cleaned Lenox out, me and gang in the A
ARP, I can't aim with the Drac'
Pop him in his hairline, blow his brains through his face
Showin' off, fuck around, pull a fifty out
Goose or the Moncler when it's chilly out
Thirty in the Glock, ARP got a Mickey Mouse
Deep in my duffle, ain't a thing finna get me out
Two fifties, bitch, I'm four twenty-fives
Ain't no fuckin' vacay, but your ho finna drive
He was reachin' for my ice, left him froze with the 9
Tour busin' through the country, on the road with the guys
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Floatin' like an astronaut, drippin' like a broke pipe
Nigga, I don't exercise, dyin' if you tryna fight
How your opps still alive? Mines will be gone tonight
Floatin' down Ocean Drive, smokin', higher than a kite
Bro caught a body, changed his name just like Dusty Rhodes
Bitch look back while we fuckin' 'cause she know she cold
Sick as hell you rattin' on your mans, bro, you know you bold
Call unc', he travelin' like Harden, somewhere on the road
Only 'za, I ain't smokin' Breeze
Savin' hoes, y'all the Justice League
Settin' plays up, Andy Reid
Glocky on me, blow it like a whistle, he was T'd
Ain't nobody drinkin' beer, Wocky or the Casamigo
Catch a body like he cheer, knock him down just like a free throw
Gettin' head, could hardly steer, wasn't hip she was a freak ho
Goin' broke my only fear, juggin' shit just like I'm Deebo
