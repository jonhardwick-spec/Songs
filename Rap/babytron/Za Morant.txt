[Intro]
Brrt
Yeah, you know what the fuck going on
Yeah
[Chorus]
Bitch, I ball like Ja Morant, but I can't sport the number twelve
Clutch as hell, you can't count us out if the score close
High as hell, I need a parachute, but this ain't
Warzone
Why he tryna flee on feet? This Glocky got a sport mode (You're not making this easy, Kyle)
[Verse 1]
Don't let him catch you in the D, my hitter pescatarian
Why he acting big and bad, but always be on extra scary shit?
Shit, if the money dirty, take the check and bury it (SBDSM, you think you fucking with us, you drunk as hell)
[Chorus]
Bitch, I ball like Ja Morant, but I can't sport the number twelve
Clutch as hell, you can't count us out if the score close
High as hеll, I need a parachute, but this ain't Warzone
Why he tryna flee on feet? This Glocky got a sport modе
[Verse 2]
I just know the case beat, I might walk in court blowed
Clothes used to say, "South," now the ice on North Pole
I ain't fuckin' with you, I was bored, ho
Think he fuckin' with me, he a dork though
(Yeah)
I done built this shit from nothing like it's MinecraftRed bottoms on, I'm lava stepping like a mineshaft
So many backstabbers, I might play the riot shield
Two-tone AP, when it hit the light, you think the diamonds teal
Why you drinking Taylor Port? (Why?) You a major dork
Tryna keep up with the gang like eating steak with paper forks (You can't)
Said he on my head? Shit, I'm real concerned
Pop out, drop his ass and grab the tag, shit, that's a kill confirmed
Hit him where it hurt, we aiming for his jugular
Acting like you serving bricks, your pockets, they on customer
Everything I'm seeing fake, I ain't wearin' an Oculus
All the fiends up on the block, it look like an apocalypse
Brodie throwing gang signs, you'd think he know some ninjutsu
Humane Society, the kitchen got like six Shih Tzus
Knocked the wheels up off his Bugatti, now it's a Ducati
Why you always dick suckin' the gang? You need a new hobby
