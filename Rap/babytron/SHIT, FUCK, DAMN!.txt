[Intro: BabyTron]
Bitch, yeah, huh (
I got so much Enrgy
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Seventy-five or better for a eighth, I only blow exotic
All-black Amiris with the leather like I'm going gothic
I'll pull the fully out and bring the ho up out 'em
Big roll on me, got yo' bitch in here blowing Johnson
In that widebody doing donuts, I'm a jackassTurned his hood into Baghdad, now he a hashtag
201, doing Saks bad, I'm finna bag drag
Old bitch bugging, had to block her with her mad ass
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Anywhere you see me at, I got blick regardless
Chop got a hundred .223's, could hit any target
Hellcats up the ave', hear the Kitty barking
Ass full of silicone, her cup full of Rémy Martin
I was broke once upon a time, I can't go back
Tryna fight? We'll leavе him holy like the pope, Jack
Goosе for the winter, thousand dollars on my coat rack
SBDSM full of shitters, but you know that
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Firebomb the spot and put a claymore at the door
Up off a deuce, but if I pour a four, I'ma snore
Ocean Drive, you might catch me flooring in a Porsche
G-O-A-T, feel like Mike Jordan on the court
First 5K, you want the vid'? I might need seven
Reach for this chain? Guarantee that you gon' see Heaven
I ain't never chase 'em, I was dream catching
Fifty-some' pair, got a European sneak' fetish
