[Intro: AllStar JR]
(
Let's get a bag

Chill goin' crazy

(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
Ayy
[Verse 1: AllStar JR]
Talkin' to my plug, "Can I punch 'bows?"
I can't cheat, my bitch crazy and she punch hoes
Your bitch droppin' her location like, "Come on"
'Fore I cut you off, you a bitch that I'ma cum on
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Hoes used to talk crazy, they on hush mode
Let me find out this bitch heard I'm the Punch GOAT (Hah)
Zap his ass with this new Pack-a-Punch pole
Rock him for a band with two sticks like a drumroll
[Verse 3: AllStar JR]
One whip, two chops, we spinnin' the block (Spinnin')
Two-man, a hundred shots, we spinnin' his top (Baow)
I'm on everything these niggas is not
Would've scrapped last year and now niggas is dyin' (Woo)
You feel that lead, right? You could feel your legs, right?
Beefing with R, you ain't finna pop up dead, right?
Know it's green if we see you at a red light
Both scopes on a nigga, them bitches like headlights
