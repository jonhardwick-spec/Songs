[Intro]
(
MK, you like a wizard with this shit
)
(
Me and Brando, we are on it
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
What the kicks cost? Uh, touchdown (Touchdown)
She a freak bitch, put the cuffs down (She a slut)
Used to ho me but she wanna fuck now (Okay)
We could talk money, got a lot now (Let's get it)
We could take a trip, but where you wanna go? (Where you wanna go?)
Think we falling off? Nigga, you must be slow (Dummy)
Unky on the phone, he said it's on the floor (Let's get it)
What I paid for this? It might just be a 'bow
'Wood full of flavors, I can't tell you what I'm smoking on
Dumb question me, go ask yo bitch and see what she be on
I'ma keep balling for the niggas who wanna see me gone
All-white buffies on my face look likе provolone
Bitch cute as fuck but her butt look likе a backboard
If the head is good, I cannot lie, I'm coming back for it
What a dummy, tryna beef but he ain't got no strap for it
He a bot, every time he cop, his ass get shorted (Lame)
Bitch, I'm in the game, feel like EA Sports (Let's go)
If she ain't sucking dick, I might have to abort
I go and get the dough like I grabbed the door (I get it)
You ain't really swiped a piece in the store (You ain't never)
You ain't never even pressed shit, fake stepper (You ain't do that)
Fucking hoes in a mansion, feel like Hugh Hefner
Finna go get buffed up like a bench-presser
Lame blocked me from her page when he saw I text her
Palm Angels cardigan, I'm looking just like Carlton
Know some niggas sick and think that we can't get as far as them (Shit)
Found out that they talking to the pigs, gon' have to slaughter them
Spending racks on clothes, remember when I used to borrow them
Bitch bad, had to beat it up, I feel like Chris Breezy
Boy, you better not even leave the scene until your shit empty
At the dealership, I want the fastest whip that get to sixty
And I'm riding 'round with Curtis Jackson, choppa got fifty
