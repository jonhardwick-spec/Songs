[Hook]
Face six 'Woods, now I'm big high
In a rush to the pape', big time
Strap hanging out the bag, that's a big .9
If they put you in that room, you gon' 6ix9ine
I ain't lying, I'm big time
Hit Saks, light thrust, yeah, it's drip time
750 Yeez' jugg, that's a quick five
On South Beach hitting dimes 'cause I'm big time
[Verse 1]
SB in the lab, I can't switch sides
Caution cone on me, I ain't letting shit slide
All hustle, no luck, I'ma get mines
Stan said that we winning, that's a big bible
Hit that bitch from the back, I'm a soul snatcher
If she try and take a pic, I'ma phone grab her
If I lift the buffs up, I'll be swole after
Free smoke through this bitch, you don't want cancer
Gregg Popovich, I'm on the drawing board
This a head shot, what the fuck's the armor for?
It's kinda fucked up that I ain't got a heart no more
I'm big Tron, touch me and you gon' start a war
I'm a shooter, yeah, I used to ball a little
To the pape', hell yeah, I might jog a little
Off-White, black and white, I'm a fraud official
Hellhounds with me, I'll send a dog to get you
