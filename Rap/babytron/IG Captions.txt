Huh, ayy

Ayy

[Verse]
Never once in life did I try and be somebody else
Deep down inside, feel like I don't need nobody help
Dub after dub, I just know this shit come with L'
s
Balling on my own, I went through pain ain't nobody felt
Talk shit, wipe my mouth 'fore I leave the booth
Paul Pierce could be your fucking pops, still wouldn't be the truth
With some hell-raisers, skrrt off, hear the Demon zoom
Bloomingdale, Saks, finna fuck up Neiman's too
Let me tell you something
All that tough talk, when it's smoke, just inhale you some
Shot clock cheese, boy, them boys got a bail out bucket
Since high school, shit, I ain't really fail on nothing
Real life, ain't cap since I wore a gown
Tried to lock me out the game, seen the door and tore it down
Used to watch LeBron, I take heat down to Florida now
Used to wanna be the star player, I'm performing now
Huh, yeah, you better guard me
High as hell, forgot the whip don't even take no car keys
Me and Teejay on a play, shoot at Far East
Playmaker, used to ask coach, "Can I start, please?"
Walk a lil' drip, come through, talk a lil' shit
Before you run with the bag, you gotta walk a lil' bit
Good zaza, yes, bitch, I'm off a lil' bit
Ain't no gender switch on this chop, it chalk a lil' bitch
Money team with the punches, what up, Floyd?
Kudos, them buffs ain't from Hutch, boy
Broke than a motherfucker, need a crutch, boy
Scam God, pulling twenty jacks off of one 'Droid
Runtz got me outer space, I'm flyer than an asteroid
Play a dirty game in the city, we the bad boys
You cannot slide, your whip ain't even got no gas, boy
Buy it for the low, same day, I'ma tax boy
They say time is money, but I wish I could borrow hours
Money on your head, Bape zip, bet my shark devour
Bicep in the widebody, hear it start with power (Skrrt, ayy)
Threw a twenty ball at my bitch when she started pouting
Tryna run off, crack his legs, we'll Harbor House him
He can make it, but he can't stack it, worst part about him
If he don't use his head, sneak up and knock the smart up out himDamn, now his brains on the sidewalk
Bitch said I'm broke, let my chains and my ice talk
You ain't spending pape', please get up off the skywalk
Played the game, now it's .223s in your drywall
Bathing Ape with the Human Made, it say dry all (Woo)
Grab the money out the shh, then I drive off (Woo)
Two-four-seven with it, fuck a night off
Like underneath your eyebrows, bitch, I ball
Andrei Kirilenko, got an AK-47 tucked
Pop like it's fudge, started off as a 7UP
Three off a credit, slide six off a debit punch
Thinking I'ma lose the long run, okay, bet it up
No hooks, no chorus, all Instagram captions
Drums here, sticks there, it's looking like this band practice
Exotic Backwoods like my shirt, I got bad habits
Vlone tee for the free off of scam magic
They can see me balling from the farthest seat up in the crowd
If I ever hear it's up with doggy, put him in the ground
All that lil' spinning shit dead, I can hit her now
Bitch asked for money, that's like asking me, "Do fishes drown?"Like, hell nah
Said that I'd come up quick as hell, what I tell y'all?
I been up since I got up, I ain't fell off
It's 2021, do not ask if I sell sauce
Fuck an L, lately I just really have my mind on wins
We gon' come back to back for bro if you slide on him
Punch God, remember all them nights tryna find a BIN
Got the force, I'll swing the stick like I'm Qui-Gon Jinn
Yeah, bitch, I'm feeling like a Jedi Knight
Pretty lil' bitch finna give me the head I like
You miss the shots, crank your badges up and get your deadeye right
Lil' bitch won't hop off my dick 'cause I said I swipe
