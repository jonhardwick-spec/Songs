[Intro: BabyTron &

Phew (
Brrt

Long live $cams (
Let's go, go, go, brrt
)
ShittyBoyz (Phew)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(
Meech
)
[Verse 1: G.T.]
Tell me why they cap like they get paid for it (Why they cap?)
My baby Tron 'bout to go on another tour
This time, we brought Certified Trapper, let's score (Ayy, ayy)
I couldn't go broke 'cause I'll get my money out a whore (For real)
Hop in a coupe, make the pedal hit the floor (Vroom)
Bitch want allowance, she don't never do no chores (For real)
I'ma be a hood nigga straight on the Forbes (Yeah)
Off an eight, got a nigga late to thе awards (Phew)
Trunk in the front, the motor in thе back
To everybody who doubted me, I'm gettin' racks (Frrt, beep)
I heard you niggas broke, don't tell me that's facts (Yeah)
A hundred 'bows sold in one day, close the trap
[Verse 2: Certified Trapper &
BabyTron
]
I could make a forty in a day, no cap
If it ain't a sealed eight of Morty, nigga, I ain't tryna rap
The lil' bitch super skinny ass, I ain't tryna clap
Brodie put him on a shirt, niggas wasn't tryna rap
Get split with some particles
Man, them news reporters on my dick in them articles
Bitch, I'm out on bail for a switch and my arsenal
If your mans told, you a bitch, that's a part of you (
Phew
)
