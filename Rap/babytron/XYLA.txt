[Verse]
All these dollars that I got, how I ain't got no sense?
We got xyla', we got dog food, we got some fent'
Shit, you from Romulus, that's not a trench
Like some kneecaps that's irritatin', bitty got me bent
You might smell a lil' Creed, but this a zotti scent
It's been weeks, they still don't know where his body went
.308 hit him in his dreads, give him a Taki head
Fucked up in the head, we smokin' out of body bags
Eastside in it, my wrist, I'm in my Maserati bag
Lil bro'd die for this shit, he—
Lil bro'd die for this shit, he in his kamikaze bag
The way she ride thе dick, shit, she in her Kawasaki bag
Wouldn't stick it in her, shit, shе in her hot tamale bag
Hop up out that black truck, it ain't the paparazzi flash
Is your pops really ballin', in your Bronny bag?
I'll pull up 2 K's, in my Ronny bag
Got it zipped tight, ain't no peekin' into Tronny's bag
He was tough as hell, now we smoke him out of zotti packs
The Don got me sweatin' bullets, I need Gatorade
You a pay-to-player and you drinkin' haterade
Unc' servin' food on the 7, it ain't tethermade
Ricks look like Chucks, we smoke more 'za than Taylor Gang
Put out fire on his head like an ashtray
These 448s, don't ask what the bag weigh
Get out the way, this the fast lane
If you ain't in first, it might as well be last place
Huh, double R-ing, I can't drop a Jag'
Butterfingers, I can't trust him, he be droppin' bags
Zips and up, don't come 'round tryna cop a half
Why he think he ballin'? He ain't even got a badge
They ain't even got a badge, boy, that's not a 'Cat
Where the fuck the wasp at? Boy, that's not a Scat
Where the wing decal at? Boy, that's not a Track'
Boy, you only shot a bystander, that is not a hat
Ooh, that's an oohwop, that is not a Zack
I only hit Neiman's with Marcus, rather shop in Saks
He ain't doin' shit in life, it got his mama mad
Let him take a step off that porch, gon' have his mama sad
This a fuckin' Loose Leaf, not a Zig-Zag
When I throw the braids back, it ain't RiFF RAFF
We got spots like giraffes, this the sixth trap
Turned it to a laydown, I thought it was a kickback
If you don't stay down, bro gon' catch his fifth hat
You still skip-lag, I used to skip class
BTA, step out of line, we gon' whip ass
Supercharged Ram so fast, I might get whiplash
Shotter pop two X's like, "Where his crib at?"
I overdrove two X's like, shit, I'm big high
'Ll wipe your nose in a blink, yeah, that's big slime
I've been chillin' lately, shit, now it's drip time
I don't know about your targets, but I hit mines
I ain't losin' sleep 'bout it, shit, I'm big fine
Huh, they say I'm actin' big time
Ballin', if I talk my lil' shit, gon' get a big fine
Her baby daddy workin', can't go home until my whip shine
2027, guarantee I make the whip fly
TRX god, mile mode, can make the whip climb
He ain't never left the porch like some wind chimes
