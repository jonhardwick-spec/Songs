[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, what the fuck, Daniel?
)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Thousand-dollar sneakers, but the tee was four-fifty (
Danny G on the beat
)
All this motherfuckin' motion, I might leave a ho dizzy
Bitch, my neck look like an ocean, your ho tryna go fishin' (
Damn, JakeSand
)
European sneakers, bitch, my toes say my shoe size
Quick to put an opp on FOX 2, they think he Roop Raj
Lookin' like my fuckin' overall, boy, I got two 9s
'Til I D-I-E, I'm DSM, bitch, fuck a new saga
[Verse 2: MJPAID]
Bust in an opp bitch, she gon' have to get her tubes tied
I'ma double back if it's green, mister two-time
Shit, catch me in that lane, RTA up on my Kool Kiys
So many fuckin' sticks up in the crib, it's a tool shop, duel shop
Brother got a Glock and like two chops
I ain't trippin' on no milli', that shit comin' in like due timе
Gotta peep the signs, I can see 'em with my two eyеs (Shit)
I got an eight of Stilpane, we need two pops
[Verse 3: Fordio]
I was bustin' off the drank, tryna fight my nod
Shit, since a youngin, I knew I was ahead of my time
We just scored a six-pack, goin' line for line
Just know I'm burnin' out if you catch me in your town
Been runnin' miles, know they hate us up at Enterprise
Finna pour this whole eight, heard it was a drought
He don't never got no pape', love to run his mouth
Shit, I been punchin' shit like Tank, clerks, knock 'em out
