[Intro]
NyahNyah
[Verse]
The gang full of terrorists (What?)
The waitress charged me fifty just for some asparagus
Bitch, I know I'm arrogant (Woo)
Wasn't born rich, but my son finna inherit this (Ha)
Walk into the booth and treat the mic just like a therapist
The type of broke that you is, ain't no repairin' it (Get off)
You said you went and caught a hat, I see you wearin' it
Fifty weighin' on me in Maryland, put that on Marilyn
My white boy test the pill shot out the garrison (Phew)
Bro hoes make my nose run I need some Claritin
Wasn't born on earth like why they think that I'm American (Nyoom)
Why they think I'm human? (Why?)
Said she love me for me, why she think I'm stupid?
Play green but I'm OT, why you think I ooped?
How I pull up shootin', you would probably think wе hoopin'
Check the box score
My ho said shе need a couple thousand, check the top drawer
They'll miss out on their own blessings tryna block yours (Dumbass)
The way I'm ballin', I should rock shorts
Banshee with the laser, hit a pig, turn him to hot pork
Shit, I just flew south, grabbed the bag then shot north
Ain't no rego' sleep bitch, this a thousand dollar, ayy
Ain't no rego' sleep bitch, this a thousand dollar pop snore
Burberry scarf lookin' like I done came from Stockport
Ain't no point in knockin', we the type to make 'em lock doors
Life a movie on the top floor with popcorn
Blessed and highly favored, hundred chops, that's ninety lasers
Why they staring out in public? Might be fans, they might be haters
Huh, either way it go, I'm ready
Think you fuckin' with the gang? You must've eat a bowl of fetty
