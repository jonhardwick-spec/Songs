[Intro]
Whew, whew
Erm
Bitch, ShittyBoyz, real Dog Shit Militia
You know what the fuck goin' on
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
It's over with, yeah
[Chorus]
First class, row seat incase I gotta piss
Everyday shit, flyin' around, I just dropped the six
Free Unky, he the chicken man, I think his watch a brick
I don't give a damn, you been a ham, why you hoppin' dick?
First class, row seat incase I gotta piss
Everyday shit, flyin' around, I just dropped the six
Free Unky, he the chicken man, I think his watch a brick
I don't give a damn, you been a ham, why you hoppin' dick? (Okay)
[Verse 1]
Booted up, but go get suited up, I feel like Popovich
They knew it's us, they see us shootin' up, we in a rocket ship
(Okay)
I do too much, they say I blew too much, I spent a scholarship
The chain new from
Hutch
, go do the
buffs
whеn I rock this bitch
You gotta listen, neph'
They say I ain't thе man, I think these bitches deaf
SBs
on my feet cost ten, triple S (Brrt)
Fuck my ex ho, shit, I wish 'em death (I swear to God)
Fuck the opps, boy, they out here gettin' stretched
Think he plugged in, chopper hit him, make him disconnect
So much ice out of Hutch, look like a bowl of crystal meth
C8s and Z06s, ridin' 'round, switchin' 'Vettes (Skrrt, skrrt)
Poor clerk, I'm finna hit her with a left (Bee)
They don't really want it, they be talkin' shit indirect
Up a meal ticket, you the type to go and get in debt (Fuckin' loser)
Practice makes perfect, I won't miss a step (I won't miss)
She gon' choose me, I'm what a bitch select
Pull up, shootin' on the opps' block like we in the rec' (Yeah)
Whippin' Trackhawky, cuddy whippin' in the rex
In the booth, shit talkin', need to get some Crest
(God)
Dollar signs on my mind, I gotta get 'em (I got to)
If we slide, homicide, boy we bound to kill 'em
Why yo' homie up in jail? You need to pay his bond to get him
We hoppin' off the jet 'cause it was fences I was hoppin' wit' 'em (Erm)
(
SBDSM, yeah, ShittyBoyz
)
