[Intro: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
(
Okay, KMoney
)
Yeah
Come on, GlockBoyz, nigga
Boy
[Pre-Chorus: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
The type we step inside the trenches (Inside these trenches)
We get to hoopin', boom like Mike, I'm Scottie Pippen, yeah (Baow)
My niggas dangerous, my niggas, they so different
Mone had some hoes, come set the play and kill you and them bitches
My lil' doers, they go do shit, they ain't gon' call me when they finished
Right now I'm pullin' up on my auntiе, I just came to use the kitchеn
[Chorus: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
We got black trucks, black chops and black hoes
I got black Glock, black mask and black clothes (Boy)
[Verse 1: The Godfather]
Cash rules everythin' around me, that's C.R.E.A.M. (Boy)
I just woke up, it ain't even 10 AM, I'm pourin' lean (I'm sippin')
Tried to run, but he couldn't get away, got followed by the beam (Baow)
I couldn't find a pint of Wock', so I'ma settle for the green (I'ma settle for the green)
We in black masks, black truck, fully make 'em back up
You ain't heard about the last security guard that act tough
So many damn lines inside the pop, they made a black Crush (Damn)
AMG the Benz, I'll crash it 'cause we rich as fuck (Boy)
You might catch me servin' niggas, smoke on the floor, we purgin', nigga (Boy)
Glock so hot, it's burnin' niggas (Ha), can't give me nobody, I earned it, nigga (I earned it)
Outside strapped up with my killers (Yeah), don't worry 'bout me 'cause I already killed 'em
Catchin' a hat, it's a wonderful feeling (Yeah), five face shots of Dracy ended (Bitch)
