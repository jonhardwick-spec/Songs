[Intro: Tae Retro]
Tae Retro, Tae Retro

I got so much Enrgy

[Verse 1: Tae Retro and
BabyTron
]
You wanna learn spice talk, I can teach you something
Rainbows off the chain, I ain't reading nothing (Nah)
If you see me in the stu', then I'm up to something
Chasing for a ring, she still lost, DeMarcus Cousins
That just mean that she's outta luck
It's a late show when I rap, got the magic touch (Baller)
Seen numbers off the rap, I ain't had enough
Gotta grind, I've seen hard times, I've had it rough (Talk to 'em)
But I'm on to some better times
Heard bro last song and he bet on rhymes (Simple)
You sell weed and still broke? Need a better crime
Blank out when I'm on the track, I lose my mind
They say crime don't pay, that's a whole lie
Don't believe me? Go and ask Tron, he can tell why
The day I cuff a rat, you'll see pigs fly
I ain't putting clamps on these hoes, not a fun guy (What?)
Got your girl clapping from the crowd like a soccer mom
Rap god, punchlines from the Pantheon
This game takes a long time, it's a marathon
If y'all rolling out, then we slide like Decepticons
Heard you put your trust in a ho, that's a rookie move
Put my all into the rap, what I got to lose?
Know I'm nice with the bars, I ain't got to prove
Can't compete and deep down inside, that bothers you (It do)
What's comp'? I'm on top of the leaderboard
If she ain't giving up the neck, what I need her for? (What?)
Couldn't even look at the fit, now I'm leaving stores
Finna cop a Sprinter with the guys, I need to tour
If you switch sides, then you know that I won't forgive
You always beefing with the opps, you must hate to live (You gon' die)
Do a verse for the low, then I'm off the grid
Say you was better than? (
What?
) Yeah, you off the meds
