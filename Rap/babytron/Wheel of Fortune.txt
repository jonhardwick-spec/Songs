[Intro: BabyTron]
ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: StanWill]
On the road for thirty days and thirty nights
No punches through this bitch, doing thirty fights
Circled on the opp block, we hit thirty rights
Looking at my future like you staring up at thirty lights
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Don't ask what's in the cup, don't you see me with the Drank God?
Don't ask do it hit, don't you see me with the Punch God?
Tapped in, get a nigga touched like a iPod
She wanna make a movie, set the cam on the tripod
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Punching like a black belt, I'm a card master
Emotionless, I'll leave a bitch heart shattered
Good cappage on the 'Gram, you're a star actor
In store with fire, bitch, I'm flaming like I'm Charmander
[Verse 4: Icewear Vezzo]
Yeah, pop a school bus, I'm a bar master
Big chop that'll knock a nigga car backwards
Two beams on a Glock like car hazards
Drank God, bitch, I'm balling like March Madness
