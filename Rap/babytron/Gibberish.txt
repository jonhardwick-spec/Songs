[Verse 1]
Thinkin' you a model, lil' ho? You just a bottle girl
Pop a yerky, then I send a ho to Wobble World
What I'm rollin' in my leaf, as loud as Baby Kia
We won't even pull up striker, fuck around and ATV him
In a lose-lose situation, I'll still win
Yeah, I'm out the way, but don't forget that I'll still spin
The feature price been goin' up, you should've paid that ten
All it takes a week of shows for me to drop a Maybach Benz
Hit the zotti 'til I'm out of oxygen and Oxy’, uh
U.S gettin' borin', I might fly out to Slovakia
I play both sides of the ball like I'm Jaden McDaniels
They can go ahead and spin the block, we gon' make 'em examplеs
Vision 20/20, how this life shit been a blur?
My ho must do acupuncture, she knows how to hit a nеrve
I'll let it fly, you think the money had some wings
I might slam her through the bed, I'm off some honey and a P’
If I got a problem, call me Ian, I'll figure it out
I heard doggy took a
Fetty
Perc' and speaks gibberish now
Tell the ho to “Wipe them fake tears, we ain't kids”
Can't believe, said you had some Zagaza, these straight mids
CPL-ies on us, run up, we gon' catch a self-defense
They can't even sit me, I'm on fire, might just melt the bench
Icy as a bitch, these chains three-tone like Bomb-Pops
Shooter gettin' bored, he catch you out and might just drop shots
First time I shot a gun, it was at somebody
First time I sipped some mud, it was by myself
Outsider, I don't fuck with y'all, I rather vibe myself
Started in the game, I couldn't tell you how the sideline felt
Dog ain't never made no pros, he just a D-leaguer
All that glazin' that he doin', call him Mr. Meat-Eater
My white boy crazy, he'll kill you with a meat cleaver
Deep sleeper, what I poured into my cup, it treats fevers
You would've thought he knew it all until he blew it all
Said he shootin' me, but when we hooped, he wouldn't even shoot the ball
Finna make it rain, I told the strippers it's a flood warning
Let somebody bump me in this bitch, gon' have the club scorchin'
I got a (Pfft), to calm my nerves down
It was through the window, I can hit the mall and splurge now
Plug just brought so many (birds chirping) I almost bought a birdhouse
