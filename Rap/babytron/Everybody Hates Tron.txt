Ayo, Mark A

Everybody hates Tron, I'm just shit talk— man
Fuck
Huh
[Verse]
Everybody hates Tron, I'm just shit talking
Thinking that he crispy, pull up, snatch the drip off him
Unc' don't breed dog, but you can get some pit off him
Seen six opps slid down, boy, that's six coffins
Hundred dollar eighthy, heard you spend that on a zip of reggie
Straight on you hoes, I swear you bitches messy
Dog Shit Militia, got a twenty chillin in the techie
High as hell watching classics, couldn't finish Belly
Finna take a flight off an eighthy of some Jet Blue
Spent your car note on my left shoe
Shitty chain, white buffs off the test tube
Chess player, boy, you better make your bеst move
Two-five-eight, on thе grind, ain't got time to play
High as hell up at Loose Cannon, tryna find the Bape
Won't scrap you, but I might have to fight a case
V12, if I push the pedal, I'ma fly away
Exotic lifestyle, lungs full of Runtz smoke
MacBooks, iPads, I got a truck load
Yoga teacher, pull up on your bitch, make her touch toes
Foreign sneaks, bitches always be like, "What's those?"
Huh, on fire, got the shirt with the X
Magic man, I'll turn the worst to the best
CA tenant, hear a growl, finna swerve the 'Vette
Bitch-ass boy, you always crying, you deserve a dress
White buffs looking like a roll of paper towels
Married to the money, I'm just waiting 'til she say her vows
Brock Lesnar bullets in the clip, they'll take 'em down
In the chop, got a silencer, but I'll make it loud
I know you got a headache smoking homegrown
Mad as hell, I can't bust a scam 'cause my phone froze
If it ain't ten or more, then that shit a no-go
Bouncing out with sticks like we pogo
Nike SBs like I skateboard
I don't fight, but if I do, I'ma leave his face sore
Bitch tryna throw the pussy at me, but I'm straight, whore
Currys in this big motherfucker make the Wraith roar
Mark load the sample up, I'm finna talk crazy
Shooting off the Wocky, whole time, I didn't ball lazy
You better leave while you can, I'm a dog, baby
Before the rap checks, shit, the fraud paid me
Everybody hates Tron, shit, I'm counting pros
Told y'all on Jesus Shuttlesworth I was bound to blow
Big Shitty, all that little petty shit out the door
Tried to get unky sauce, he too busy 'round the stove
