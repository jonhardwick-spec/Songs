[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Walking in my shoes, it's gon' hurt but it might take a mile
Keyword "my", how the fuck you gon' take my style?
Mean-mugging, upping like a dub, I can't fake a smile
Only thing raw is the cone, bitch, that ain't my child
Only thing I haven't punched yet is a house
Only thing that I see on your bitch is a mouth
Red dot with the, yeah, I'm zooming in and out
Coach Tron, OT , audible, I switch the route
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Ayy, I got red tips in the chop, put some chesters on him
I just touch down with some jacks, did the Hester on 'em
One phone call'll get him, feel like Lester on 'em
Left him dead right on the floor tryna wrestle on
[?]
Balenciaga stepping, it's Off-White if I do the Mikes
And before I ever lose a fight, he'll lose his life
Opp called me "broke" like he he a doofus, right?
For them loose screws, niggas know I got a toolie tight
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Man, I'm flyer than some pilots, I don't need a flight
How I get these niggas plates and I ain't get a bite?
You was cuffing broke bitches, I am not the type
This some [?] dub looking kinda light
I keep getting money, going places you ain't never been
She a soul snatcher, man, I'm waking up in Hell again
You gon' catch the nearest Uber if you miss the mail again
You gon' fuck around and vomit if you hit that [?] again
