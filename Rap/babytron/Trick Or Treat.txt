[Intro: Taylor Dayne]
Do you know how lucky I feel I am
To find a man who loves me as I am? (
It's Hokatiwi
)
You never try to change a single part of me
[Verse 1]
Thousand dollar meal, I can't read what the menu say
Calamari, oxtails, and some crème brûlée
Never under-achievin', we N-U-A (Never, never, never, never)
Played out the ARP, this a M16
Got the pint at 10:00, drank it all by 10:16
That's a line a minute
When cuddy step into that kitchen, he ain't fryin' chicken (Nope)
Loose leaf, Slapwood, I'll play both
Ironic, it's a ghost gun 'cause this bitch'll make ghosts
Sеventh game, I ain't choke, you should sit and takе notes
Fucked around, did the Wock' slush, it left my brain froze
Said you poured a eight, bro, must be all Karo
Wake up, tote banana clips off the Bape row
Sweat them boys two times, think the series eight-O
Probably think the S, "sport," but it stand for space mode, this a UFO (Nyoom)
In the whip, doin' shrooms, that's a boombox (Damn)
DFE, catchin' plays in the boondocks
At the line, down one, two shots (Yah)
Guarantee I hit both, shit, who not?
You the middleman, sold bowls, never grew crops
They ain't even competition, think I need some new opps
Cut into your bitch, had her oozin' like a juice box
Turnin' in my Apple products, I can't let the fruit rot
