[Intro]
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
Reuel, stop playin' with these niggas
(Long Live $cam)
[Verse]
This lil' ho like Pat Summitt, she be settin' plays
Yeah, I heard his last song, it's more weak than seven days
Don't call me Jimmy, it's been Tron since the seventh grade
Head to head, it ain't no way you beatin' us in seven games
Sick'll hit Tris, her drank man must wear boxin' gloves
All she wanna do is fuckin' fight, this some toxic love
Chips Ahoy Rollie on my wrist with the chocolate chunk
Brodie fightin' life, I just told him, "Only God can judge"
I just hit his ho, he must've been droppin' thе blunt
Put a bounty hunter on him like Jabba The Hutt
Unk' damn nеar DPOY how he lockin' it up
We ain't bringin' in no groceries when we poppin' the trunk
We just waitin' on your low, you gon' drop it or what?
When it's time to ride or die, you gon' hop in or what?
Time to show 'em what it is, I don't pop it enough
Used to hit the store with three bucks, now it's lobster for lunch
If the pop ain't cold, it ain't drop worthy
Touchdown in the Bay, I feel like Brock Purdy
Spot never ever close, you can honk late and knock early
Thinkin' that he trim, but we done peeped that his socks dirty
When we put him belt to ass, it ain't like Grandma whoopings
Rollin' up dessert, mixin' wafers with banana pudding
Shotta jumpin' out a tree 'cause you ain't had no bushes
3:55 at the lab, me and Lando cookin'
Boy, pour some trizzy in it, why your Fanta plain?
Mike Evans, shit I got a play to catch in Tampa Bay
Swingin' sticks, stingin' shit, we the Tampa Rays
All that other shit don't matter, I'm the man today
I'll survive on my own, you seen
Castaway
?
Heard he tried to run up a bag and it ran away
Everything hate me this way, y'all some bantamweights
Taxin' everybody, I just entered my Fanum phase
Huh, we don't live life the same
You was born with snake skin, don't you see this lion's mane?
They gon' end up drownin', this a motherfuckin' tidal wave
Talkin' 'bout she love me, told her, "Put it on the Bible, bae"
Huh, and I still won't believe it
Nah, for real, is it even any real hoes that's breathin'?
Chop' kick like Vinatieri, need a field goal to beat 'em
Matter fact, go for six, I need to feel more than even
Oldheads bitter, really just mad it's our era
Pop out, rockin' forty-one like Alvin Kamara
Mike Jack, arguin' with the man in the mirror
Hand in the air, tell my bitch, "Like, I had it to here"
L-A-X what? This Atlantis, we landed the leer
Man, you a weirdo and that's with a capital weird
Car goes capital, look like tactical gear
Ain't no snacks in this kitchen, pussy, we trappin' in here
Let's put the tester on your chain and let the world see
Spot an opp in the crowd and turn to Metta World Peace
Heard he said I'm weak, I'ma let the world speak
Should I step on everybody's necks or let the world breathe?
Head glued to a swivel, I gotta stay alert
All these damn blessings gotta be 'cause granny stay in church
Huh, Hallelujah
The same ones talkin', they be late tryna find a way to work
That ain't za 'cause za just 'cause it's sprayed with turps
Tronny number one just like Jalen Hurts
Stop askin' where I'm at, ho, 'cause it ain't on earth
Bro a gremlin, take a Perc', chase it with a eighth of purp'
