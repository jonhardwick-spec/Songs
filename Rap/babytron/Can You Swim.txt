[Intro: BabyTron]
You out here burning bridges, can you swim though?
You out here burning bridges, can you swim though?
You out here burning bridges, can you swim though?
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
You out here burning bridges, can you swim though? (I hope so)
I ain't tucking shit, I got my kit on (Bling)
Get the bag in and dissapear, I feel like Bilbo
Score however, throw a touchdown or kick a field goal
I heard you still broke
Shit (Phew), I need a parachute, I'm fly as fuck (Yoom)
Ha-ha, nah, for real, I'm in the sky with it
Life different (Phew), you can tell by how the ice hitting
Better keep your eye up on that hourglass, your time ticking (Your timе's up, buddy)
Scoring champ, I went and threw some sixty pointеrs in the Cartiers (Bling, bling)
I just spent an hour in here wrestling with these RTAs
Dog Shit Militia, we got more choppas than a army base
Drankhead, I'm chasing acorn like the Ice Age (Like a squirrel)
Unky playing with that— tss, turned it light beige
It can be money, can be time, they say crime pays
Wax in the Backwood, I'm living life the high way (Phew)
Flying out the driveway, bitch, this a Urus
Quarter ticket on me, taking flicks, life picture perfect
Lift his body in the— uh, this shit get disturbing
Told him I'll make it to the top, shit, I been determined (Haha)
Watch it lock into a rock when I get to stirring
Hit his block, pah-pah, then we get to 'urking
Leg on the bed, hit a bitch, she gon' get to squirming (Come here)
Pick him off, then talk shit like I'm Richard Sherman (Yeah)
I'ma get the first worm, I'm the early bird (Ooh)
Took his kit, he'll get it back the thirty-third (Haha)
Five of Quagen, brodie faced it, he got slurry words
Glocky got a blue Perky in it, let the thirty jerk (Phew, phew, phew, phew)
