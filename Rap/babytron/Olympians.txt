[Verse 1: Damjonboi]
Goddamn, it feel good to be a real nigga
Free my nigga 80s, wish that I could crack a seel with you
All you gotta do is keep it real with me
Missing my niggas, all this money, still feel empty
Don't compare me to them niggas, this ain't the same shit
Bae ass too fat (Shit), I done came quick
How you hating on your baby? That's some lame shit
Louie bags and Baccarat from my main bitch
Flying up the 7 switching lanes (Skrrt-skrrt)
They know I'm a boss, but this shit came with pain
Got on all white sticks downtown in the Range
Fuck a bitch then leave, now she downtown in the rain
I said *Super Saiyan 3* was my last tape
I was bullshiting, tryna make a bag shake
I be one nighting hoes, this your last day
Zone life 'til I'm gone, yeah, that way, hmm
Jumped on 696, headеd to the west
Soon as I pick up this bag, I'ma hit the sеt
R.I.P Hutch, I got VS1's on my neck
She just wanna fuck, 'cause she seen me pull up in a 'Vette
I know them niggas like how the fuck he keep dropping fire?
I know my haters like like do this nigga ever get tired?
Took some rap money, built an empire
Bitch, I ain't no new nigga, my shit been fire
Man, this rap shit silly
Engineer press record, niggas turn into killers
And it's cold outside, I'll never slip (Yeah)
Break bread with the niggas I was stepping with
And you ain't been the same since that one incident
We ain't gon' bring it up, just know I remember that
Make a bad bitch show off for me, yeah, I'm in the back
Took his shit and it was fake, now I wanna give it back
Fuck the bullshit, it's my turn again
Looking like I'm tryna get the last word in
I remember days they was like, "Never heard of him"
Yeah
