(
This bitch hitting, Danny, you hear me?
)
[Verse]
You won't catch me working in a office, I'm my own boss
Dog $hit Militia, we ain't worried what the low cost
All that humble shit dead now, I'm finna show off
Shooting what? Wintertime, wouldn't even throw a snowball
Black Russ', put it in rotation, now I'm activated
Stack something, why you always at the crib? You acting lazy
I think you really hate yourself, I don't think you actually hate me
G-O-A-T, my jersey where the banners hanging
I can talk shit, walk drip, bitch, I do it all
Yo team would've won a couple games if you would move the ball
He was talking crunchy, .223, I sent it through his jaw
Overtime up in the lab lately, ain't been doing fraud
If we catch yo plug, he gon' need his system rebooted
Running out of bullets, flip the clip, switch, and keep shooting
All that fake tough shit y'all do? I can see through it
Tryna clear my mind, just reclining on a beach, cooling
Y'all can't fuck with me, just a quick reminder
Ain't nobody with me throwing jabs, nah, these some pistol fighters
Dawg asking back to back questions, where's his hidden wire?
Stop talking 'bout we kin, you wasn't with me in the fires
Crack a joke? I'll put you in a suit like you Steve Carell
Hit his bitch on cam and sent the vid, he can keep that L
Fraud God, thank God that I ain't never seen a cell
Why yo mans sitting in jail? Y'all must not believe in bail
Been the chosen one since day one, that's just my destiny
Of course dubs matter but the L's is where the lessons be
Come and get yo bitch, she right on D like the letter "E"
If they see what's in the trunk, I'ma catch a felony
Then I for sure can't get no damn job
201s, 101s, I'm jamming till my hands throb
Got it out the mud, now we winning by a landslide
Yo boyfriend a burger, bitch, you looking like the damn fry
Huh, oh, y'all a Happy Meal, ain't y'all?
When we slide down and, it ain't paintball
Three-five of Runtz knock me out like it's Jake Paul
Winning ain't the same without the haters, gotta thank y'all
ShittyBoyz up now, can y'all stop snoring?
If I'm on FanDuel, bet on me 'cause I won't stop scoring
My Asian pull up with a harpoon but it is not Norbit
It's fucked up yo son gon' be a snake like you Bob Orton
Visa kit, hit the reader with a RKO
They always talking 'bout when they be loyal, not the part they don't
If you hit this Turtle Pie once, you gon' start to choke
Headliner, still'll turn it up if I start the show
Bitch, I'm only twenty, young as hell, shitting on yo pops
I ain't worried, in a minute we'll be sitting at the top
When you hop up in yo bag, make sure you zip it till it lock
You can hear the time ticking, nah, I'm tripping, that's his watch
