Whew
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
Cut into the bitch like a samurai
Grave diggin', I'll send you to the afterlife
Caught an opp out, let's get it crackin', guy
I can see me winnin' from the jump, I'm a mastermind
Devil on my ass, guess that the pastor right
Fucked up, but it comes with the scammer life (It does)
If it ain't Jay Ale's, ain't no appetite
Hit the Runtz, flew up and damn near hit a satellite
I ain't finna scrap, do I look like Rob Van Dam? (Huh?)
Might turn into doggie if the chopper jam
Eight hundred dollar bundles, this bitch out of hand
Jumped in the deep end and turned into Aquaman (Splash)
Most hated where I'm from, gotta live with it (I do)
See an opp, JJ Watt, I'ma hit stick him
Used to be the lil' dawg but I'm big trippin'
Day, a thousand in my bag, lil' bitch, I been in it (On God)
Bitch asked where I'm at, sent the bag emoji
Pack a punch with the scope, ain't no scrappin', homie
Gettin' head on the 6 while I'm passin' Coney (Skrrt-skrrt)
Feel like Clank 'cause you know I keep that ratchet on me
If it ain't SB, can't get jiggy with it
Even mama dukes know that lil' Jimmy trippin' (She does)
Best Buy online, grabbin' fifty inches
"Scam" is my four-letter word, feel like Diggy Simmons
Can't trust fishy bitches, boy, you know these bitches swim
On Telegram with a Russian, goin' BIN for BIN (Facts)
Took them L's to the jaw, feel like Crimson Chin
BabyTron, I'm damn near the hottest out of Michigan (I'm on fire)
They was lookin' for some gold, I'm the hidden gem
Somethin' like the One Punch Man, this bitch hit again
I'm in first place, really used to wish for wins
Seen an opp and did the Sub Zero, bitch, I finished him (Froze his ass)
Capping-ass boy, go ahead and grab a beanie
If I was Mario, I'd scam Luigi (I would)
Moose Knuckle cold, lil' bitch, it's scammin' season
In church foolin' on the side while the pastor preaches (Amen)
All black Nike Tech, I'm a scampire
Punchin' up for six hours got my hands tired (Goddamn)
Hittin' hoes off the strength, feel like Quagmire
If he slide on us, guarantee it's gon' backfire
If it ain't bein' broke, I will not fear it (I won't)
If it ain't about the money, I will not hear it (Probably won't)
Destruct stores with this punch, Lord Beerus
Four opps ran up, they left out as four spirits
They can't fuck with me bar-for-bar
Draggin' bags out the mall, feel like Charizard (Fire)
If you see me in the Bape, that's a heartless shark
Hold down the brake and push a button just to start the car
Crackin' jokes with the clerk 'cause the card legit
Tomahawk'd your bitch, it was hard to fit
This bitch head A-1, let me park the whip
Not givin' a fuck and some paper is my starter kit (Gang)
