Tricolored Hutch pendant hangin' off my neck, got my nose runnin'
(Chilly in this bitch, where my Goose at?)
It's a couple niggas hate my guts because they hoes love me
Twenty pointers off the mirror tint, I did the froze buffies
(Dumb-ass nigga, ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Milita
Whole lotta gang shit, nigga
Yop, come on)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Brodie off the boomies, still'll boom an opp
Lookin' like a chemist in the lab the way I do the pop
Titi think she Uzi, all she wanna do is rock
Your bitch in that C8 lappin' up, I'm in the coupe with thots
In that water, I be armed up like an octopus
Chandeliers hangin' off my neck, I made her stop and look
If they flick the lights, I bob and weave, you know I dodge the hook (You don't even get that shit, though)
Thirty ball in all dubs on me, got your bitch amazed
Made a ten from the crib, I ain't do shit today
If the blicky on me jam, you'll get Triple H'd
Told a bitch she fuckin' with the boss, she tryna get a raise
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I was rockin' Fendi F's in school the whole time you was gettin' A's
Bitches disrespectful, whole time, pussy be on fish fillet
I be 'round some killers, you would think the block was Crystal Lake
Used to hit the bank and walk out with illegal slips of pape'
Sick your mans ain't see a pendant, only had the pape' to print 'em
Yohji Yamamotos cost a K and plus it's pape' that's in 'em
With my 'rillas sippin' Quagen, spill some on my Bape, I'm trippin'
Double team me, I'm still ten toes, learned to play my pivot
Told my shooter, "Ooh, kill him with the Drac'," like he Terio
Bank robbin' spree, that's the worst-case scenario
Turnt up off the boomies like a stereo
And they don't know my shooter's name, he lied and said DeMario
