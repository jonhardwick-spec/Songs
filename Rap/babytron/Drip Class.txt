[Verse 1: ScrumbleMan]
Designer tee with the Crocs, fuck getting dressed
Reaching for my pocket, bro got his ass stretched
Time to stuff this bitch, this yo first test
Fuck a right hook, doggy hit with the good left
White boy shooting a black, that's a racist kid
Put the metal to yo mouth, how yo braces feel?
I need five hunnid for a gram, fuck a deal
Send a opp up top to God, this a gracious meal
Zazas and the Wock', I'm in a different state
If you tryna act tough, come determine yo fate
Bro checked yo bitch, that's a different mate
Foreign bitch with a fat ass, that's a different cake
Tron took mе to J. Ale's, got a steak
Thumbs up to the GOAT, I don't peep thе hate
Real nigga, not a ounce fake
I'ma run this shit the fuck up till my legs break
