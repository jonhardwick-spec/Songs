ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
Acting tough? You get stumped out
Hit the interstate, run a route then I touchdown
Getting money, now all the bitches wanna come 'round
I was down but the tables turned, bitch, I'm up now
Smoking Bubblegum Gelato, thinking of a masterplan
2022, catch me speeding in that Lamb' with Stan
We ain't kin, don't reach for dap, we ain't slapping hands
If it's on the 'Gram, it ain't real, doing man to man
Slam dunked all in yo bitch, I'm playing bully ball
Backpack Boyz to the chest, this a Cookie 'bow
On fully, reach for this chain? Let the fully off
Out in public, got a image now, can't take the hoodie off
I'm tryna put a dub up for every time I took a loss
Speaking of them L's, every one I took, I shook it off
I'll leave a bitch in
BFE
and have her looking lost
Had to cut her off because she never understood a boss
Undisputed champ with the fraud, where my belt at?
Ghetto angels guarding me, I'm riding in a Hellcat
Clearing giffy racks, mama thinking that I sell crack
Always bounce back, it ain't nothing that I failed at
Won't stop hustling till my jersey up there with the banner
Bro like Thor, riding 'round clutching on the hammer
You got a trophy on yo neck but if you tuck it, it don't matter
They tryna grab me by my heels, they see me coming up the
latter
Bitch, you better check the power rankings
Getting irritated, phone beeping while I'm counting Franklins
Stay away 'cause when you open up yo mouth, it sound like hating
Locked in even during recess, wasn't out there playing
When I drop a Prezzi, I might make the caption "Tronald Reagan
"
They was happy I was broke but now they got the frowning faces
Stop playing, you know damn well you pulled that out yo savings
Hoes used to spin me, same bitches talking 'bout our fame
I can't even make this up, bitch, I only came to fuck
Put my double cup in the freezer, I done made a slush
Still wearing True Religions? Boy, you need to hang 'em up
RIP Kobe 'cause I feel like him when he dropped eighty-one
June to August, I might blow a bag but after that I'm stacking
Up at five in the morning, bitch, I'm Mister Track The Package
Oh, you fell off? I thought that you was in yo bag, what happened?
If you on that rim, that's okay, I'll meet you at the basket
Closet got designer this and that, I can mix and match
Hop out thinking that y'all tripping then we tripping back
Once yo brother six feet deep, y'all can't get him back
Out of town on my rapper shit, where the sprinter at?
Newest Track.2 Balenci runners, they ain't got a scuff
Fast break, if it's 201s, I'ma lob it off
Yo whole gang could be up in a sauna, y'all ain't hot as us
Tryna start a war? I promise what y'all got is not enough
