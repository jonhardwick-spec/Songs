[Verse 1: StanWill &

I’m gon’ make it last forever when I get a run
(Run that shit up forever, bitch, fuck it)
That’s a marathon
Buying 'Woods, bitch, I’m in the Tesla at the Marathon
(I don’t even take gas, why I’m at the gas station?)
Pocket got a light, shoot him like a camera, we with all the action
Life a movie, they be pulling scripts, look like my dawgs be acting
Feel like Clank, you see me at the function, know I brought the ratchet
Ju'll pop out with that Polish rifle, it got all attachments
(
I’ll knock yo head off if you reach for it
)
I’m getting rich, I ain’t gon’ die trying
Reaching for the buffs? Boy, you will die trying
She don’t want no flowers, my bitch like diamonds
Looking at that nеw C8
like I just might buy it
Up the hunnid rounder, this bitch last forеver
If you say it’s up, we on yo ass forever
This bitch mandatory, take the MAG wherever
She don’t suck no dick? I show her ass the blender, no cap
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Shit, I did it masked up it, it ain’t no need for a sketch artist
Blood flow purple full of Mauri, bitch, my chest heartless
2016, I was in that Nike Tech starving
Six years later, shit, a dub’ll get the set started
Tour bus around America, we finna rock some shows
US to Europe, finna rock the globe
Yamas stuffed with chicken, fat as hell, these are not Girbauds
.308s hit his head and high-top his ‘fro
X on my vertebrae, Off-White, ain’t serving yay'
Every play successful, ain’t gon’ lie, it’s been a perfect day
Like, shit, thank God
Only time you caught a hat is when you went and played COD
Since you want smoke, slide down, turn yo spot to Sherbinskis
AR with the Mickey Mouse, waving sticks, Walt Disney
Militia member, of course I got some dog in me
Not the same as unky cuts though ‘cause he got some dog in him
Crazy that I got a ball on you, could’ve balled with me
Plug gon’ piss me off with that shit, tryna stall with me
Don’t bring school up, you wasn’t in the halls with me
Caught an opp out and left his drawers shitty
