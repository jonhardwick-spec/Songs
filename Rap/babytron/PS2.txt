[Intro]
Phew

[Chorus]
He tried to go MIA, I got some Zoes out that way
Pint had a verse in it 'til I poured out an eight
Already conquered planet Earth, we need some shows outer space
Can't believe he walked out like that, doggy clothes out of date
Gettin' drank from TX, gettin' 'bows out the Bay
He can't run a check up, think your bro's out of shape
Bitch put the head on me, knocked my soul out of place
Never had none in my blood, I don't know 'bout the hate
[Verse]
He ain't built for thе pressure, see his bones 'bout to brеak
Ain't a single witness left, they 'bout to throw out the case
Time to throw out the Drac', this bitch dirty as my Starry
You a fuckin' lil' boy, I'm scorin' thirty if you guard me
Last time unky played a game was Kirby on Atari
Thirty pointers, ice cream, got a McFlurry on my Carti's
We just servin', but it's lookin' like a turkey drive
Cuddy said he see a pool of tens, he gon' Perky dive
Overdid the shrooms, I think I felt the earth rewind
Bitch see what's on my wrist, I guarantee she slurp me dry
I had hustled before wireless like PS2
Chains VS, watch VS, ring, yeah, that's VS too
VVs all on my body, I might catch the flu
Fiend pulled up to the lab just to test the tube
It ain't Sam's Club, when they pull up, test the food
It ain't a counterfeit marker when they test the blues
Yeah, you hard, but you at yo' peak, only the best improve
If I pull up with a sealed pint, don't expect a deuce
Really, don't expect a damn thing
Came a long-ass way from that scam page
Tron for President, at least that's what the fans say
Join the campaign, hey
