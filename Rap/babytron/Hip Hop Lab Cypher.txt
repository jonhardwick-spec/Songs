Threw a flash on the—, bitch
[Verse 1: StanWill]
I done threw a flash on the Glock, my aim picture perfect
Broke every rule from the jump, the game gettin' dirty
We on 36 and our clique tote James, get a Worthy
Too much 'za smoke for the buffs, my frames gettin' blurry
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
Mmm, drop some candy in the pot, make M&M McFlurrys
Hit it twice and birthed a white tan baby like Ayesha Curry
I came stars on the kicks, Stephon Marbury
It's papе' on my mind, an M state, but I ain't play for Murray
[Verse 3: Peeko]
Rasheed Wallace in the pharm', cuddy gеt the Tech
Motion sensor set up on the back, they detect the threats
Big nigga, get his head shaved, Steve Wilkos
Call the opps Nemo, found his ass in a fishbowl
[Verse 4: Hit Em Hec]
Uh, put silencer on the TEC, it barely make a noise
Shoot doggy in his neck, now he lost his voice
Now he gaspin' for breath, he ain't got a choice
He don't know that we keep ladders like the Hardy Boyz
