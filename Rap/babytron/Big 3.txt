[Intro: BabyTron]
Hot and spicy chicken ramen noodles, you don't know the
Bitch (
808JACKBOYZ
), shit
SBDSM, SBDSM
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Hot and spicy chicken ramen noodles, you don't know the struggle
Thinking that he tough in that Moncler? Gon' blow his bubble
Throw a 7.62 at him, I ain't throwing knuckles
Touchdown with the bag, boy, you ain't supposed to fumble
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Knowing damn well that's yo bitch, I'ma like her pics
I ain't fighting shit, .223s, they'll ice yo clique
Shoot a cannon at his face, I ain't making licenses
Rule breaker, fuck the law, bitch, I ain't abiding shit
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Peter Chan on the chop'll make 'em Double Dutch
Strapped like a dyke, it been a minute since we knuckled up
Cut into this bitch like, "Girl, them niggas cannot fuck with us"
Did her like I'm Martin "Sorry, baby, I don't cuddle much"
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Boy, we just taking off, this yo last hurrah
Akhi and habibi slide together, send yo ass to God
I mean Allah, back then rock smashed the Dawn
It ain't the big three if ain't Dee, Stan, and Tron
