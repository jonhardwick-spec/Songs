Long live $cams

You know?

[Verse 1: BabyTron &
Los
]
If it ain't no drank in my cupholder, I'ma get some road rage
Wu-Tang, I'm the method man, my killer Ghostface (
Uh-huh
)
Tryna say my vows to the pape', I think we soulmates (
Uh-huh
)
If they order beef, bet we deliver it like Postmates
(
Yeah
)
Out in China, flickin' people off with my pinky ring
Come and get the cuffs up off your bitch, she into kinky things (
Fuck that bitch
)
Ayy, tell a bitch to leave me be
Why you rollin' reggie? Might as well've grabbed some
CBD
[Verse 2: WB Nutty]
I been tryna keep it all rap, but I'm for the streets
BabyTron, tell your white friends come and shop with me
I been payin' fourteen, but gettin' twenty-eight apiece
Make a song about some sales, niggas better mention me
Know how I play it, I go get it, I don't wait around (At all)
I'm sendin' 'bows to her crib, playin' "Pound Town"
Airport, no luggage, pick up fifty thou'
Bag gone 'fore it touch, ain't no sittin' 'round, nigga
Get your rank up, get your rank up, get your rank up, get your rank up
Get your rank up, get your rank up, get your rank up, get your rank up
