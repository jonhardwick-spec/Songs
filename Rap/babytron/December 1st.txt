[Intro]
I'll give you love, I'll give you loveI'll be there for you when you need meI'll be your friend and you can count on me
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
I'll give you love, I'll give you loveI'll be right there when you need meI'll be your friend and I'll be there 'til the end
[Verse 1]
Doing sixty in the coupe, whole time, my mind racing
Fuck a bitch, boy, it's Franklins I'ma die chasing
Got a lil' pape', now everybody in my life changing
I-75, roadrunner, always highway-ing
Eyes red as hell, but my buffs' lens lavender
Slide on the opps, we might come ten Challengers
Free my babies in there walking down calendars
Pretty bitch riding passenger, might throw a bag at her
Two hundred dollar beanie on and I am not capping
Every play I draw be a six, they call me Tron Madden
Woke up to my jack, I was faded off the Wock', napping
Since 2016, I been in my Crocs scamming
[Interlude]
I'll give you love, I'll give you loveI'll be there for you when you need meI'll be your friend and you can count on me
