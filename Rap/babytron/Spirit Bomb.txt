[Verse]
Dukes said I'm out my mind, no, I'm in my luggageWould've said I'm in my bag but I'm out of town punching
It ain't the dunk contest but the trap house jumping
Feel like Harry Potter, I done turn nothing into something
I ain't Luke but I hit the set skywalking
Pull up to yo block just so you can die on it
Fit sweet, it got the lil' bitch eyeballing
I'ma just do this shit, I don't like talking
You woke up with a ugly bitch, I woke up to a package
Hit stores like Wreck-It Ralph, I'ma do damage
Swear to God I need a Fit Bit, I'm too active
Fuck trying to reach the finish line, I done blew past it
This bitch a demon, how she arch it up
Take them shoes off yo feet and throw them far as fuck
Dinner at the 'Hana’s, no, you ain't starve with us
T-Rex engine, it's gon' roar when I start it up
Don't play with my cheese, that is not this
Fuck hibachi, eat a opp with his chopstick
.223 bullets hit his chest like a drop kick
Left the freak light headed, lil' bitch got spinned
Man, this cap is beyond me
You can't slide, boy, we know yo tank be on E
My shooter got range, I'm talking 'bout beyond three
Bro always shooting shit, I told him get back on D
Big chop, it'll blow you back like a
Thundergun
We four deep like Ninja Turtles, what's a one on one?
You can't duplicate Tron, I’m a one of one
Athletic-ass opps, see 'em out, they run for fun
Half man, half thrust, I am not human
I'ma ham this ugly-ass bitch if she don't stop choosing
Up the heavy metal, boy, I don't fuck with rock music
I ain’t from the West, I throw up dubs 'cause I’m not losing
I ain’t grab the Glock out the mystery box
Used her for the neck but she hip to me now
Get the face from her then I hit the re-rock
Good Runtz
got me flying, bitch, I'm in the treetops
Ain't gon' lie, lil' bitch, you ain't bad at all
Catching Z’s off the Wock' like it’s Dragon Ball
Fit water, I'ma splash like a cannonball
Hit the mall like fuck a choice, I'ma grab it all
I ain't young and turnt? Bitch, you sound retarded
Real road runner, I done traveled more than Harden
Got shit on-lock, threw the spare key in the garbage
Painted pictures when I step, feeling like an artist (Margiela)
Grinding hard lately, getting closer to my dreams
Amiri thigh pads, hunnids poking out my jeans
Played my cards right, went from Joker to a King
Call the bitch "LeBron" 'cause she choking for a ring
If it's money in the air, I'm hopping out my shoes
You couldn't drip like this if you was hopping out the pool
Talking 'bout kin? Dude, stop it, we ain't cool
Cool two on me, hit the set shopping for some Loubs
It feel good fucking on this IG bitch
Pieces been fire and my IP lit
It’s hard not to jugg, man, I like free shit
Chop spin, it got kick, on some Bruce Lee shit
Black-ass fit, walk around like T’Challa
Feel like Shark Boy, I sent the bitch in with lava
Ksubi jeans sagging, on some wet-ass Gabbana’s
Jumped in the deep end, wasn’t scared of piranhas
Pussy A1 but she always starting drama
You gon' kill who? Boy, put it on yo mama
Stick got ammo like I grabbed it out a llama
Shitting on these hoes, I'm the man like Juwanna
Tryna scrap? Let the chop do the Spirit Bomb
All I fear is God and my drip, that shit Fear Of God
Punchline after punchline, I'm the Lyric God
Bitch used to put me on mute, bet she hear me now
Cheese for the free, I make sleeve after sleeve
Margiela footwork, ain't no three in the key (Paint stepping)
I'm a dickhead, paid three for the tee
Plain-ass tee, cost three for the V
