Ooh, Sav killed it

[Verse 1: StanWill &

]
Goose on, iced up with stick like a snowman
Gen5 Glocky, pistol whip him if the pole jam
Black-ass tint, the sticks white as Lindsay Lohan
Take a 201 and slam dunk that bitch with both hands
Both hands on yo bitch noggin, pushing down her head
Sipping blood like I'm Dracula, can catch me 'round some red
I got three hobbies, like to rap, scam, and count the dead
Talking 'bout some zaza? You smoking out a pound of reg'
Whole gang in thousand dollar coats 'cause the streets chilly
Please take that pendant off yo neck, that lil' piece dilly
Dream chasing, all I really want is Meek milli'
Asking what I paid for the fit? It was free, silly
Skillet on the yop, boy, this shit'll cook the beef, really
Opps broke, only get some cheesе when they eat Philly
Was sleep on mе, now the bitches wanna sleep with me
720 in the Trackhawk, I'm in the Jeep dizzy
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Big motherfucking .308s, they'll pop yo melon
Don't know what the opps do with shoes 'cause it's not no stepping
Put the head on me first, bitch, the WAP go second
Catch you mean-mugging in the club, be done popped yo section
Flames on the Palm Angel kicks leave the petal burnt
Rock him for them bands, show you how that heavy metal work
I'll crash the server, catch a opp up in the metaverse
Knot poking, staring at the stripper, bitch, you better twerk
