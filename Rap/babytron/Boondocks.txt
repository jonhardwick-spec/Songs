[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, bitch
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'm in the boondocks, ridin' 'round with two chops
Eighth of shrooms in the Scat, that's a boom box
Fuck them two chops, I got two Glocks with two thots
How we finna play it? I got three pints and two pops
How the fuck this finna go? It's one burner, two pots
You and your mans, do the math, boy, that's two cops
Collateral, we let off one bullet, hit two tops
We ain't aimin' at your arm, you think these flu shots?
No Nut November, so I'm overdoin' it October
BabyTron been hip since he was scootin' in a stroller
Cuddy aka an earthquake, just moved another boulder
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, I seen your name up in another folder
[Verse 2: T Bone]
The bitch said I love her funny 'cause I never told her
That shit even funnier, 'cause I don't еven know her
Fuck it, you might as well givе the gang coochie
'Cause you the one in this bitch actin' like a groupie
Lookin' for a JT with my lil' Uzi
She said she only at the party for to shake her booty
Jumpin' out in Gucci, truck on the Ruccis
Leave a nigga gang runnin', screamin' out, "They shootin'"
Your shit was boring from the start, get to the conclusion
If the boys get behind me, I'm fleein' into Luding'
Walk around with blues on me like I got bruises
The bitch asked me was I lyin', I am not Lucious
