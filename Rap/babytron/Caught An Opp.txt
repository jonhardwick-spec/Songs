[Intro: BabyTron]
Bitch, I'm fuck as drunk
(
Deggzy
)
Yeah
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Caught an opp at the barber shop, I'm finna run his fade
Hmm, you want a taper, huh?
Twenty K the long way, bitch, I made a dub today, huh
I got grown man paper now
We can't do a song if yo' name on some paperwork
Talking tough on the 'net, that's how the haters work
Don't let us catch you out
Do Pilates with the ARP, my shooter stretch you out
[Verse 1: TrDee]
If-if-if you ain't down to suck no dick then you can exit now
Niggas Plankton, stealing sauce and try to take yo' style
Called her phone like, "Where you at? Ain't had it in a while"
Niggas kickin' when you down, can't let them see me frown
With yo' lil' bitch, we not just Netflix and chilling
Turtle Pie, she hit it, now she higher than a ceiling
Orange Scat Pack, hit the gas and get to peeling
I won't tell yo' friend, now turn around and let me hit it
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Shit, if it's on the floor, it's in the atmosphere
Far as hell from the hood, shit, I damn near smacked a deer
When I-when I jumped in my bag, that's when a bag appeared
Turn around, scoring down in Cleveland like a Cavalier
Five Glocks, ten chops, bitch, we war ready
Finna snore, this a six, I only pour heavy
You-you talking 'bout some fucking Tris, where the Quagen at?
Used to hate, now he want a eighth, I'm finna lace his ass
Caught an opp, finna shoot, mace and tase his ass
Wake up getting straight to the pape', I guess my patience bad
