[Intro: J1Hunnit]
Showgod is the man

You're not makin' this easy, Kyle

1Hunnit
[Verse 1: J1Hunnit]
Hollerin' like a million-plus or better, what's your take? (What's your take?)
At first my pop was clear, I dropped a four, now it's opaque
I wake up, be fly as hell, first thing I do is get some pape'
I told my bitch to quit her job, my label finally got me straight
Trackhawk movin' like a griffin, I soar through the lanes like Blake
I just pulled a triple-double, middle end my index take
I don't even write this shit, it's off my mind, this shit innate
They keep tellin' me be patient, what if I ain't tryna wait?
Rope stitch in my seems
The last nigga you was fuckin' only had two pair of jeans
Bishop and Raheem
Red juice make the ice look like Boston Baked Beans
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
We just copped two bricks of yeti, that shit cost an AP
They played they very fuckin' hardest, but they lost it 8-3
Militia member, I'm a dog, 'll make her crawl and say please
"A2Z" made me a hundred, still do fraud in AZ
Y'all was double tappin' pictures, we was double tappin' work
Better pray that God with him, up and send his ass to church
Purple Louis crewneck, the double cup gon' match the shirt
When you really thumbin' through it, boy, a hundred bands'll hurt
I got papercuts
Go and get your paper up
Said you got some drank on the way, we pourin' eights or what?
The streets a dirty game, you tryna play or what?
To make it to the top takes patience, is you finna wait or what?
