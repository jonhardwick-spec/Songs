Ayy, some Percs feel right, the other ones don't
Some Percs feel right, the other ones don't
Ayy
Huh, RJ always tripping, RJ always tripping (
RJ always tripping, man, RJ always tripping
)
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ShittyBoyz)
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Some Percs feel right, the other ones don't
Some bitches love me, the one I love don't
Crazy when I stopped hooping, I upped score
What goes around comes around, life's a jump rope
Punch God, Sleeve Nash, I'm the Punch GOAT
Went from the nosebleeds to the front row
I ain't fix shit 'cause I swear it wouldn't broke
Cranked the metеr till it broke, this that one mode
[Verse: BabyTron]
Man, why thе fuck do they hate on Tron?
I'm just tryna make some pape' in my Saint Laurent
And if he play with my pape'? Send him straight to God
Bitch a freak, got more bodies than Genghis Khan
Woke up wanting drip, I'ma hit Neiman's
Early bird gets the worm so I quit sleeping
Spud Webb in that kitty, I'ma mistreat it
Smoked a 'Wood and bought a gun, now you a big demon?
LOL, fucking cornball
Human now but I swear I was born dog
Brand new Goose coat, brush the storm off
On fire, see an opp and I'ma torch dawg
Huh, you gotta know the real comes with fake
Huh, you gotta know the real comes with snakes
Huh, secret sauce, it's still in the safe
Huh, that bitch only real in yo face
Bitch burnt a bridge, hit the store and burnt it down
For every time they turned on me, hit a turn around
They ain't fuck with the wave but they surfing now
I used to give hoes dick, gotta earn it now
Oh, that bitch? Yeah, I probably dogged her
Scored off the punch, bitch, I'm a karate baller
Spice God in the booth, I'm a wasabi talker
This bitch a demon with the neck, she her mommy daughter
Dee a volleyballer 'cause he setting plays up
I was getting neck on the live, throwing gang up
Slatt, slatt, send a, watch him raise up
Yeah, Drake Bell up in Hutch, sick I came buffs
I always hear the same stuff, you're not original
Ichiban got me in her throat, on the biblical
Always in my phone, God, this bitch miserable
Two cards, if it don't hit, do the switcheroo
As-salamu alaykum, go and greet Allah
Walk around in designer? You got three dollars
Lil' bitch called me "baby", I don't see Sada
Eating alligator bites or I could iguana
