[Intro]
(Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
[Verse 1]
Unky weighing up work (Brrt), he got some scales in the kitchen
Getting up and getting to it, making sales, flipping digits
I can't leave a bystander, put an L in the witness
Boy, who the fuck your jeweler 'cause he failed with your pendant
Big body Cullinan, might fish tail and get to wiggle (Skrrt)
Everybody sauce getting stale, please don't get offended
Akhi catching terabytes through the mail, might get a ticket
Pouring Quagy-agey in my gingеr ale, I'm feeling finished (
Helluva madе this beat, baby
)
[Verse 2]
Don't do woods, don't do wires (Nah), the gang a herd of buffaloes
Turn your lil' bitch to Gabby Douglas, got her touching toes
Spot like the Texas Roadhouse, it keep upping rolls (Shit)
Shout-out Hutch, got 'em wondering how summer froze (Fuck)
All that bitching? Boy, you need some therapy
Out of town with a beach view, I need some clarity
One of one sneaks on my feet, check the rarity
All this free pape', shit, I need to start a charity (Fuck)
Twelve month grind, I'll show you true hustle (Swear)
Point it at his antlers since he got a Moose Knuckle
.308s (Boom), three hunnid blackouts, we don't do tussles
Got our balance right, we don't do stumbles (
Helluva made this beat, baby
)
