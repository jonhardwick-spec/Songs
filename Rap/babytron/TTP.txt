[Intro]
(
KRAGER, text me back
)
Hey
[Chorus]
One thing you can't forget to do is trust the process (Never)
What the hell's a 100k? That's just a fuckin' object (Fuck)
You just runnin' stuck in place, ain't make no fuckin' progress
Presidential Rollie, I might run for fuckin' congress
Everyday we breakin' records, go ahead set the timer (Ha)
Gotta change spots, I think the feds set a wire (Sheesh)
Just in case the plug LOL'ing, I got ten suppliers
[Verse]
It ain't no one in the driver seat, how the Tesla flyin'?
This lil' ho so cold, you'd think it's Elsa by mе
Nowadays, we on the leer side, this ain't no Dеlta pilots (Damn)
Lil' bro still bitin' Apples, he just left Verizon
Boy, you got a plane pop, I'm in here red velvet Sprite'in (Ah)
We'll pop out with more green than the Celtics roster
Gift to gab, I can meet a fish and sell 'em water (Hey)
All he do is post fan shit, I can smell a blogger
Tryna keep up with militia, I can tell that boy exhausted
I'll bust two pints open like I'm Steve Austin
Twenty LooseLeaf's back to back, it got the V foggy
I'm on the chill side, you see me in Supreme joggy
I barely even gotta think, I hear the beat talkin'
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Let me lace my sneaks up, I'm on the beat walkin' (Ayy)
Wear it once and throw it out, I don't resauce it (Man)
“Roll me up, MegaTron,” I hear the weed talkin' (Shh)
“Pour me up, MegaTron,” I hear the lean talkin' (Aah)
You might be tucked but my hitman gon' keep stalkin' (Aah)
Ran out of weed? Shit, at least I got a breeze on me (Man)
Is he lactose intolerant? It ain't no cheese on 'em
DSM, he can't be one of us because the sleeves on 'em
She been eatin' dick for three hours, it's some knees on her
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
(Ha, ha)
Shrooms got me laggin' like a PS1 (Ayy)
What's on my wrist? What's on my chain? Shit, VS1's
Boy, you just one of them, you can't be the one
We been on the road since midnight, now I can see the sun (Shit)
Junkie need his drugs, unky need a plug (Ayy)
Cuddy want a gun (Ayy), bloody, wanna hunt (Ayy)
Muddy in my cup (Ayy), yummy in my lungs (Ayy)
Someone get the 'Za deodorant, it's musty than a fuck (Ayy, ayy)
(Ha, ha, ha)
