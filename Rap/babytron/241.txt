[Part I]
[Intro: BabyTron]
(Enrgy made this one)
Woo, hey
Long live $cams
SMDSM, T-double-H-L
You know
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bitch, I grew up in the jungle with the animals
Wock' mixed with Crush, cup thick like a Danimal
Bitch popped a ten and tried to eat me like a cannibal
Backdoor season, they ain’t know it was retractable
Jeffin' like you jam, DCin' like the capitol
Quarter of the Boomies, everything feeling magical
Hundred oranges, she ain’t pop 'em, though, they in her vaginal
Dog Shit Militia, when it's warfare, we tactical
Let my white boy test thе work, he said it's radical
Ain't no numbers in them columns, you ain't valuablе
Tryna stuff a hundred in these jeans, bein' irrational
God strike me down if I ain't in here speakin’ factual, Shitty Boyz
[Verse 2: Babyfxce E]
If the lil’ bitch goin', I can’t get mad at you (Nigga)
I left brodie at the crib 'cause he too fast to shoot (Yup)
I think I need a leaf bag, them turkey bags is through
Walk in with a Goyard on my back, the Birkin bag for you if you play it right (Huh)
It's glow sights on the Glock 9 so we can play at night
It's recommended you get a feat’ from me, this bitch'll change your life
40 on me, not no WD, this bitch'll change your bite
If your team ain't got no dub yet, you need to change your five
Oh, shit, I think I just fucked up (Yeah)
Was 'posed to sell this drank, but I poured it in my cup (Damn)
I had to make a hundred thousand, forty ain't enough (At all)
FiFi ain't get pulled over with them yops, but forty in her gut, she a stuffer
Made 'em buy the Smitty over the Glock, said that bitch was rougher
The gun jammed and dog an opp, man, his ass a buster
I done caught up to you niggas, got tired of bein' mustard
I bought a Century Arms K, got tired of all them Russians
