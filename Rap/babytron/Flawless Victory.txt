[Intro]
Ayy
Ha-ha, ayy
You know what I usually say
Ayy, ayy,
ShittyBoyz
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
[Verse]
You ain’t hear I’m the Punch God?
Shooter in a ski mask like he Slump God
Bandwagon taking off, better jump on
Trackhawk got my neighbors pissed like I’m SpongeBob
Ha-ha, but for real, fuck ‘em
Bitch broke my heart one time, I can’t trust ‘em
Bro painting whips, Los Santos Customs
I used to play half back, it ain’t shit to rush 'em
Bet y'all hoes wouldn't ho me now
Didn't know me then so don’t act like you know me now
It’s over now, time to throw the towel
King of the fraud, when you see me, you're 'posed to bow
Ha-ha, feeling good in this Wealthy tee
Crushing wind pipes all year, I can’t let 'em breathe
I know you ain’t mad off a petty three
Chopstick can make yo head rock like a Helly beat
I was down bad, of course I don’t mind flexing
Chopsticks like Miyagi, we ain’t fly catching
You will get yo bubble blew like an iMessage
Hop in a bag, that’s my number one life lesson
Step one, get the fuck off from on yo ass
Step two, find a hustle that’s gon’ always last
Step three, flood the stash, you ain’t gotta flash
Step four, stack a hundred, that’s gon make ‘em mad
In my bag, threw a lock on the zipper
That means I'm locked in till I touch seven figures
Feel like
Jhene
, it's some shit got me triggered
I wouldn’t DC if I played for the Wizards
Ha-ha, real life, this ain’t fake, stupid
Wipe the crust off my eyes and get straight to it
I’m not a poor sport, dawg, I just hate losing
Fifty-two cards like a deck, hit like Ray Lewis
Where the shoe doctor at? Man, my shit creased
I just stomped doggy out in the Big B’s
Bronze Bomber
in the store, this a win streak
Burnt my finger tips self-scanning, bitch, this BIN heat
Ha-ha, man, this bitch a big freak
You can keep that lil'-ass song, that bitch been leaked
First time I touched ten, feel like Big Meek
You just got hip to BabyTron? Bitch, I been sweet
Ha-ha, made twenty off a fake page
If he do the race, give him fifty like he Tay-K
Sleeve Nash, everyday feel like payday
Off-White turban on, clutching on an AK
Paved waves, this a new wave, better start surfing
Changed waves, bitches gon’ change, left my heart hurting
Same plays, just a new day, boy, these cards burning
Finna have a play day in Saks, I’ma start splurging
Flawless victory
