[Verse 1]
Every star player has an off night
I turned off-brand into Off-White
Guarantee you run up on me, that's a lost life
Your boyfriend a dirtball, this that sauce life
Stamina in credit, boy, I'm running up a check
Track star in Saks Fifth, I'm running up the set
Run up, try to flex? That's a hunnid to your neck
I got 'em sick, bro, they can't stomach what I spent
I'll still talk shit if I ain't have a mouth
And I work for this shit, it wasn't handed out
I knew the bitch was easy, I ain't really have a doubt
Used to crack jokes 'bout the kid but I'm laughing now
Hoes used to ho me, I ain't need them though
I ain't scared of death, bitch, I'm scared of being broke
Look in the mirror, hell yeah, I see the GOAT
She sent my soul through the roof, yeah, she a pro
We ain't up now? That shit new to me
Shoot me? Wouldn't even shoot a three
I don't scrap but the punches are like UFC
I'm plugged in, charged up like a USB
Hockey sticks, we'll slide like a Mighty Duck
You a dickhead if you try your luck
Fire hazard every time I'm 'bout to slide a dunk
Raf Simons on, you won't catch me in no Hyperdunks
