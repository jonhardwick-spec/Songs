(Fuck, aye, aye, aye) (Phew, phew)
[Verse]
Locked in, I gave myself the life sentence
Iron Mike DiBiase, you gon' die wrestling (Fuck)
Said he need an eighth of red, I took a five, stretched it (Fah)
Cuddy taught the dog a trick, he finna try fetching
They think I play with cheat chodes, just found the right settings
Fuck a deuce, you ain't school, hit my pop with a trimester (Trimester)
Five star wanted level, get away just like Lester (Like Lester, skrrt)
We some kings, y'all some clowns, treat you like jesters (Like jesters)
Would've put the drugs down, like, livin' high better (Swear)
When my members steppin', it's aggressive
R.I.P to Speaker Knockerz, flexin' and finessin'
Shit, I wouldn't show off, 'cause we'll turn that nappy fro into a mohawk (Brrt)
I need a six, really all I know is go long
Twelfth round, still swinging, all I know is go strong (All I know is go strong)
I'll have my white boy, pull up, blow you how he smoke bongs (Phew)
Shit, I need 'least a dub if you want me on yo' song, huh
Brought a ladder to the fight, easy W (Yah)
Plus, it's thirty, I might catch a CCW
Skinny than a muh'fucka, pockets BBW (Woo)
Off the map, one way from DTW (Nyoom)...
