[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'm finna bite down, I can show you who the alpha dog
Yeah, bitch
I'm finna bite, I'll show you who's the alpha dog
Flying 'round, giffies in the back like I'm Santa Claus
No [?] eating in the morning off of Apple sauce
Big heat, I'm talking forty shots, yeah, that's Haslem talk
Christian Louboutins with the spikes, watch me dazzle walk
NY bitch drop her drawers, it's Niagara Falls
Let me find out it's game time
Dawg out here acting like a cop, he a K9
I used to be the deepest in her guts, now she hate mine
Focused on thе hourglass, I just know it take time
Tryna eat, wе gon' give him wings like it's B-Dubs
At the BNB with freaky bitches, let me see something
And yo bitch blew me just like Curry blew that 3-1
We finna blow y'all boys out the water, better team up
In my BAPE, if I smell blood, full attack mode
Give yo bitch back with a dislocated backbone
I just hope before he hit the booth, he threw a cap on
If you catch me with the cracked 11, that's my trap phone
