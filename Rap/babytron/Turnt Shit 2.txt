[Intro: StanWill]
Bitch, yeahh, ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, that's on every sound
Bitch, what up TrDee?
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Unky' Trist' pourin'
Better hope them sharks don't catch you fish bowlin'
Call her lolli, before I pop I make her lick on it
He ain't thinkin' with his cerebellum, put the blick on it
This glocky got the switch on it
[Verse 2: TRL]
Fuck around and have to run you down, they put a hit on you
TRL, the SB youngest niggas with some kits on 'em (for real)
I done risked my life for this shit, you ain't risked nothin'
Niggas mad 'bout they lil' hoes, 'cuz they bitch fuckin'
[Verse 3: TrDee]
I was hittin' niggas hoes before I had a fanbase
Slammed her like the Big Show, I'm tryna make the bеd break
Why the fuck you pop out with that vest likе your head safe (huh?)
Strippers stop me walkin' through the door, she can smell pape
[Verse 4: TRL]
I smell mid in the air, that shit headache
My bitch told me I was single, I'm like "yeah, okay"
Your baby a [?], man lil' hoe you crazy
Got real, zip him up like he rockin' Bape
Bitch, I'm good anywhere, ain't gotta play it safe
Just for playin' with the Camp, and you get yellow taped (don't play with us)
He a small fry to me, I'm higher in the rank
Just a 7 mile nigga who love sippin' drank
Pick your bitch up, she licked the dick then we hit the bank
Go get [?] for a tester, let it hit the H
Heard it's snakes in the grass, lawnmower with the drake
He hang with the opps, tag that nigga and give him shake
