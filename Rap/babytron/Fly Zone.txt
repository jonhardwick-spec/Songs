[Intro: ScrumbleMan]
(
Enrgy made this one
)
Uh-huh
Yop, yeah
You know what the fuck goin' on
[Verse 1: ScrumbleMan]
I ain't hit the stu' in seven days now, but I'm back in it
Off a thirty fuckin' hoes, bro, I put my back in it
This an SRT, all black, we got the 'Cat tinted
Fillin' up the safe, bust a jugg, I put the racks in it
Mama mad as hell I put the juice up in the fridge
I got drugs in this house, I can't smoke up in the crib
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I can catch a brick or shoot from deep like Porziņģis
At the spot, if that ain't titi, why the door ringin'?
Caught doggy bone in Cityman, he can't afford Neiman
Trippin' off the shrooms, I looked down and heard the floor speakin'
You be poor thinkin', bet that you gon' die broke
I been fly since the Robin's with the rhinestones
[Verse 3: ScrumbleMan]
Whippits with the shrooms and the juice got my mind gone
Sick he workin' nine to five while I'm switchin' time zones
Slurrin' all my words, shit, fuck
Slurrin' all my words, mad as hell I got my lines wrong
Delta first-class, catchin' plays in the fly zone
Lightning bolt with the cursive words, I got my Kiys on
Mad as hell my bitch grabbed my shit and threw my drank
DSM versus the world, lil' nigga, what you think?
You a lil' boy to me, I'm puttin' checks up in the bank
We gon' pull up to your hood, get up with you, take your rank
