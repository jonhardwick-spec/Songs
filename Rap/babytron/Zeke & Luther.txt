[Verse 1: TrDee]
Glock just like a rocketship, this bitch'll send 'em out of space
Steady asking, "Where the hoes?" Why you ain't worried 'bout no pape'?
Right outside his crib, tryna take him out just like a date
On my grind like Zeke and Luther but I don't know how to skate
Fuck the back and forth, pull up and show what you gon' do to me
I ain't tryna fuck, just want the brain, bitch, come and tutor me
We are not the same, they notice me without no jewelry
Bitch, act like you know, you didn't know that you can Google me?
[Verse 2: Tae Retro]
Linking with the ShittyBoyz got me tripping in this bitch
Heard you was a big steppеr, why you limping in this bitch?
Heard a hater walked in, hе went missing in this bitch
Thought your brodie was a shooter, he was kidding in this bitch
I can't even leave the crib unless the bag my destination
Catch me balling with your bitch like I just called a isolation
Why these niggas tryna beef when they know Tae got higher ratings?
Separating from these niggas like I fuck with segregation
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Ain't no coffee in this cup, this a Wockiana potion
If you see me at the function, know I'm Glockiana toting
You don't catch me in the booth, you know I probably got some motion
If I ain't in the AMG, I'm in the Maserati floating
Bitch, I'm pissed off
Tryna set the play? Get you picked off
Seven hundred horses, finna lift off
Yo' bitch on me for my tee 'cause this bitch Off'
