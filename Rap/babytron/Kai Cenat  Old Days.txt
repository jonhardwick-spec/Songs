[Part I: "Kai Cenat"]
[Intro: BabyTron]
Whew
Huh, hey
Granny think that I'm an angel, Iâ€”
[Verse 1: BabyTron &
Luh Tyler
]
Granny think that I'm an angel, I was born with horns
I be ballin' on these young boys, you niggas corns
How ironic that I'm drippin', came from in the storm
You can tell he ain't a shooter, just look at his form
You can tell he go to school, probably in his dorm
Me and Tron in MIA swervin' in a foreign
Big body on Collins Ave, come and hear her roar
This bitch ain't even tryna shake no ass, kick her out, she borin' (Kick her out, man)
[Verse 2: Luh Tyler &
BabyTron
]
(Gang)
I'm with Tron in the booth goin' back to back (Yeah)
Niggas cappin' in they raps, goin' hat for hat (Cap)
I be smokin' out the 'bow, let's go pack for packPull it out and up yo' roll, let's go rack for rack
Bustdown Rollie avalanche just like Kai Cenat
Only hit the bitch one time, I won't call her back
Get the head and then I cut the strings, I can't get attachedOnly right it's me, Certy and Pat, we chillin' in the trap
So many racks, why my pockets fat, they can't get no chill
Baby see my Cuban, now she tryna fuck, this bitch a gold digger
Palm Angels Moncler collab, watch the coat glitter
It's gon' be a hot summer, it's gon' be a cold winter
(On Gang)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Whew, whew)
