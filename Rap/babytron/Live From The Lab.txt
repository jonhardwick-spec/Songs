[Intro: StanWill]
Bitch
Dog Shit Militia (
Tommy II
)
Live from the Lab, live from the Lab, bitch, we live from the Lab
Yeah (
313 Mafia
)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
If funk ain't somewhere ballin’, then he play with girl like Josh Giddey
Huh, let me chill out, huh
Fuck the limit in the droptop, tell the cops get me
Crack the top on the Wock', drop make the pop fizzy
Get him chalked, leave him hopscotched if I pop blickie
Had his ho throw me slop top, showed this thot fifty
Step on shit in 'Lenciaga, I don’t rock Rickie
Pull up, all he heard was, "Fah-fah", now his top missing
Doggy chicken little, must've just hatched
Your bitch on my dick more than my nutsack
If she ain't draggin' wagon, I can't hump that
Niggas think I'm workin' for the feds 'cause I don’t cuff rats
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Bitch, I’m in here with the gang, run up in here if you stupid
I don't really think you ’bout it, nigga, you gon' have to prove it
I be ballin' all the time like I'm tryna get recruited
I be only smokin’ 'za but you know gang and them be booted
I might fuck around and pull up lookin' like I robbed the jeweler
You can't even fuck with me, you just be hatin', you a loser
I'ma have to smack my mans if he ever cuff a chooser
Couple hundred for the pants, a couple thousand for the shooter
I would bet the bank on us, we done left 'em in the dust
Turn his crib right into rust if he ever fuck with us
Chopsticks and Glockianas, pull up, you can pick your battle
It ain't long until I'm rich, they ride my wave just like a saddle
