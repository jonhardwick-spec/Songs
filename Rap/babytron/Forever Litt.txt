[Verse 1: StanWill]
I done probably blew your life at Neiman's
Think I need a shovel on my way to scoop some ice from Zeidman's
Unky tryna kick the cup
, he tryna fight his demons
Tryna reach'll get you popped, you better play your life strategic
20/20 vision, but it's thirties in the buffs
Brodie need some dish detergent 'cause it's dirty in his cup
Think the trap might fly away 'cause all these birdies in the cut
Chasin' paper in the mornin', wake up early for a buck
[Verse 2: TrDee]
You ain't got no money, your two cents really irrelevant
I ain't bust the Glocky in a minute, it's been celibate
No, I cannot put my dick in that 'cause she be sellin' it
I don't give a fuck 'bout what they say 'cause I'm forever lit
I can teach you how to do it, fuck it, call me coach
He'll hit you from the corner, all he need is a scope
Niggas threw me in that water, I couldn't even float
Got my own wave and I'm sailin' on my own boat
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
It ain't nobody at your concert, that bitch look like sound check
If cuddy ain't complete the mission south, that mean the hound wrecked
Bitches in the crowd tryna throw some out of town neck
We sold ninety-nine 448s, I got a pound left
Off the boomies, I might morph into a pit
You ain't double up, you turned a four into a six
Gotta find the sweet spot, you can't force it with the wrist
Luka Trončić, they don't know if I'ma score or get assists
