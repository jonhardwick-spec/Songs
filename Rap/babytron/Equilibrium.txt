[Intro: G Herbo &
BabyTron
]
Yeah, yeah, G Herbo
What's the deal, Herb'?
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Mike Amiri master, bitch, I'm fancier than Squilliam
Fuck a body shot, we aimin' at his
equilibrium
I'm just chillin' with my milli's waitin' 'til the billi's come
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
What area I'm from? Bitch, 51
Quarter after quarter, stuffin' 'woods, I got hippy lungs
Swervin' tryna scale it, he got shorted 'cause my digi' jumped
Sick, they see me ballin', tryna double team and rip me up
Sick, they see me ballin', tryna knock me off my pivot
You ain't got a whip, what's in my pocket, could've bought a Civic
You ain't even in my shoes, I barely talk to critics
Same motherfuckers try to shoot the ball and miss it
High as hell, I turn thе TV on and let it watch me
Me, mysеlf and I, shit, I'm feelin' like the top three
Blessing after blessing, can't rush godspeed
How you call yourself the G.O.A.T.? Bitch, stop, pleaseHow you call yourself the G.O.A.T., but you not me?
Spot like H&M, fiends pull up just to cop jeans
M30's, they'll turn to zombies when they pop Ps
Herbo in some brand new Fazos, shit, you know my Crocs clean (Clean)
