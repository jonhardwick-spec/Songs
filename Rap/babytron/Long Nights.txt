[Chorus: Certified Trapper]
Long nights, I was on that block
Catchin' heads, goin' to school, dope boy knock
All them niggas play it crazy, got they ass popped
In the booth with an eighty, I ain't gon' lie
Niggas ain't really havin' motion, I ain't gon' lie
If the sheriffs get behind me in this car, yeah, I won't stop
Hit the gloves and the mask every day 'til your ass drop
[Verse 1: Certified Trapper]
Big sack on me, nigga, I'm just tryna catch a pop
I don't give a fuck who you witness, heard you testified
Drac' with the switch on this bitch and it's extra loud
Man, I really have my way in this fuckin' town
I line his bitch ass up then put him down
Nigga, shut your bitch ass up, you still on that pound
Bitch pussy wetter than a bitch, yeah, I'm finna drown
I don't give a fuck about this shit, I'll put it down
Yeah, I really got them G's, but I'll come to put you down
