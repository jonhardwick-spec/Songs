[Intro: Choose Up Cheese]
Choose, ayy
[Verse 1: Choose Up Cheese]
Soon as I wake up, I need a eighth
You broke-ass niggas never seen a Wraith
My weed trap spot do a G a day
Got in a high speed chase, threw a P away
My ex bitch down for a Visa case
My new bitch bad like LisaRaye
Got a big load in, it's a piece of cake
Before I spend, I'm looking for a cheaper rate
This new shit drop two fiends already
Took it to the kitchen, hit it with the Macarena
Then I toss it to my cousin like a hot potato
I'ma get it out the mud like a crop potato
Turn around to the K, I got eighties on
I'm in the bay with Stan and BabyTron
Four Cookie piece going for the eighty-five
You don't wanna collide with them shady guys
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Been threw my heart down the gutter
Put a bag on yo head and call my bounty hunter
If she see me with the roll then I'm bound to fuck her
Steven Adams type shit, walk around with thunder
I'm the Jugg President, just got elected in
Just shock the clerk with this electric BIN
Devil knocking on the door, I can't let him in
Feel like Wu-Tang Clan with this method, man
Aware of my surroundings like I'm cockeye
Thirty clip longer than the drive-through at Popeyes
In the cut clean as hell like peroxide
Yo bitch is not a dime, go ahead and drop five
Johnny Cage, get him finished with the chop
Ain't no middle ground, bitch, you winning or you not?
I ain't quickscoping when I'm spinning with the Glock
Ain't a post move when I'm spinning down yo block
I ain't never played fair, I'll choke the ref
Runtz got me flying up like I'm Boba Fett
Pray for the one times I was close to death
Throw that bitch out the whip if she don't throw the neck
