[Intro]
(
Meech
)
[Chorus]
Hit his crib, kicked the door, popped a save, get the door, hit the road
Shift the load to the spot, switch the low
Get in more with the bros, guaranteed that it's the O
I ain't never been a stingy one, you know I split the loaf
Off-White, ain't sniffin' coke, said it's cold, then zip your coat
I just locked up the dope, I ain't hit it with a figure four
Askin' do I got it on me, pussy, is the winter cold?
Feelin' like Shakari rocking gold, in the sprinter blowed
[Verse 1]
Walk until you hit the floor, I just gotta give the go
Y'all boys be crazy, wouldn't kiss a bitch under a mistletoe
Like Merry Shitmas
Shop App do its job, tracking every shipment
Caught him sipping out the casket, now he gettin' buried in it
Cartis white as milk, 'Wood, oops, all berries in it
Can't afford to leak the game I got because you barely listen
That's gon' blow my high
Asking who I do it for, whoever on my side
Why you callin' private? I'm gon' kill whoever on my line
[Interlude]
You on some weird-ass shit, you a weirdo
