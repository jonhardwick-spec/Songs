[Intro: BabyTron]
Enrgy made this one
Ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Upgrade our BAPE every season, boy, that's evolution
Bitch so cold, mm-hmm, she got the Devil choosing
Got some hot heads from PA, they be 72in
Y'all boys fucking with them rats and I can't mess with Rufus
Head stupid, blew my shoes off
McQueens on, these ain't AF1's, ain't got a swoosh, dawg
Out in Bali off fifty woods, I feel like Snoop Dogg
Acting loose, dawg, we'll send one through his roof, dawg
[Verse 2: Almighty Suspect]
"Why the fuck this nigga never die?", what my opps said
"Lil' nigga stay talking shit", what my pops said
"Let me see them hands, put 'em up", what the cops said
"Gave him twelve, light him up", what my Glock said
Bitch, I'm the flyest nigga out, I need a pilot hat
Bad hoes in and out the crib, I get a lot of neck
Glock spinning flames out that shit, where the sauna at?
Been hit that lil' bitch, where her mama at?
[Verse 3: StanWill]
The way you shoot, you must hate clouds
Got my bitch with me, mean-mugging like she hate smiles
Finna beat this lil' nigga ass, threw my pape down
Jam and I slide, hit the clerk with a fake smile
I'll have my young boy shoot like it's NBA
Big-ass AR on me, put yo fists away
This some new drip, let me tag what I'm in today
Dove in and came out the deep with a fin today
