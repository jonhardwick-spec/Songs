[Verse]
Jimmy Neutron, I'm finna hit the chicken dance
This ain't Toy Story 2 when you see the chicken man
Bitch tryna get married, I am not a little lamb
European tour, ended up somewhere in
Twickenham
Wockhardt slush, this is not a cherry snowcone
Game too dirty, your bitch givin' very low blows
All that tough talk, bet I'm somewhere where he won't go
Got this shit on lock like I done mastered every choke hold
Ricola
I don't need nothin', cough syrup, peach soda
Three sips of this and I'ma hit a deep coma
All this winnin' got them boys sick, Ebola, bitch
All these Percs, I should probably take a chill pill
Everybody lookin', I just cheesе and let my grill grill
Cutthroat, my lil' ho'll catch a body, Kill Bill
Zotterooni got me off thе rails, Thrillville
Martine Rolls millionaire, bitch, I'm a Marni menace
I can't see the hate, it's too much blood up on these Carti lenses
Dog Shit Militia, hit the function with some army weapons
Never had a hundred-dollar meal, boy, you an Arby's veteran
Cuz breakin' down—
Them [?] dude was really silver spoon, but actin' like that he was born a
goon
R.I.P lil' $cam, roll a seven, then I pour a deuce
Tryna run off with our bag, end up short a shoe
Supreme overalls lookin' like I'm on a farm
Courtesy of Sun Rock, done ended up on a star
We gon' get the drop, AirTag set up on his car
Won't go out bad, I can smell a setup from the start
If it was smoke, 2012, we met up at the park
Gave an opp so many shots, he think we met him at the bar
How the fuck is you a swiper? Ain't no credit on them cards
Any time they ever said somethin', hm
Any time they ever said somethin', it was from afar
Your life, less than sign, bezel on my arm
You havin' money like sayin' the devil has a heart
Heard he died at the G-Way, my Tesla finna charge
Bet on our opponent, you gon' lose your parlay
Never opps, it's the cops if I'm in a car chase
Ho playin' games, turn her life to an arcade
Know some scammers in the UK hittin'
Barclays
You the type to let some money burn a hole in your pocket
Can't relate, the pape' I got turnin' old, shit, it's rotten
Dog a pillow talker, really rushin' hoes with the gossip
When I say "MIA," I'm turnin' ghost in the Tropics
Shoutout to the plug, assignment understood
Off the Quag', Jesus take the wheel, Carrie Underwood
Whole lifestyle elevatin', you live under good
Stop actin' like you got the sauce, them your brother's juggs
You out here LOL'in', huh?Bein' broke is a joke, so LOL these nutsLMFAOAin't gotta say a thing, I can tell they broke
Your last name should be Ham like the LA coach
On Fairfax grabbin' drip for the LA show
Told my bitch stop callin', I'm in LA, ho
2 a.m. at the
Beni truck
, I'm in LA blowed
Bitch doin' all that talkin', show me what that pussy 'bout
An eighth of what I'm blowin' cost about a Cookie ounce
Aw, shit, the bullies out, they brought the
fullies out
Ain't no leavin' 'til we pay, they gon' have to put me out
Out in Indi' scorin', Tyrese Haliburton
Twin Challies, these some Siamese cats we skrrtin'
Fifty-day tour, then it's straight back to workin'
Unc' said the day they let him out, he straight back to servin'
They like, "Tron, what bag you in?" (Mines)
Smokin' mids, pourin' green, you ain't high
That's a hundred-dollar tee, you ain't fly
So much game to soak up, you ain't wise
Scored a sweet sixteen, poured an elite eight
Ain't no point to race, you ain't even got a V8
Iced-out Audemars Piguet, still'll be late
Still tryna win sweepstakes, you a cheapskate
Why you uppin' throwbacks? It ain't 2020, bro
Eyes on the prize, I'm talkin' 20/20, bro

Watch how much space gets created, 2024 (Ayy)
Tron for president
