[Verse 1: BabyTron]
It was a boogie-woogie night, we made a movie, right?
He ain't schooled, not a tad bit, livin' the newbie life
Ridin' in an all-white Ghost, this the spooky type
Pull up on your block droppin' shots, unc' like, "Ooh, he nice"
Leavin' out of Trop' with some Wock', get my smoothie trife
Drank got me slumped, sleep
Zoti got my thumbs green
Drank give my cup rings
Zoti, I'm on blunt three
I don't get enough sleep
How I'm thinkin', fuck sleep
Had to take the knife up out my back to go and cut beef
[Verse 2: Certified Trapper]
Pull up in a foreign, each smack got a button piece
If you crunch that line, you get spanked for no fuckin' reason
SB Dunks off the new Bathing Ape tee
Hit a nigga bitch from the front, shе tried to rape me
A million on my mind, but I'm thinking 'bout somе bakery
He had to face the Katy blunt, nigga talking 'bout facing me
Puttin' niggas six feet in the dirt, I don't play for keeps
Plenty fuckin' water in the boat, told 'em, "Anchor me"
Everybody get low like it's Flo Rida
Hit him in his eye with the glizzy, now he foresighted
Everybody laughin' and they jokin', it ain't shit funny
Everybody laughin' and they jokin' 'til it's more dying
Fordi pull up with some Tris, I need more PAI
Put the .40 up in your shit, that's a bull's-eye
Slide on a nigga on tip, all .45s
Lay a nigga down on they shit, couldn't afford a pipe
