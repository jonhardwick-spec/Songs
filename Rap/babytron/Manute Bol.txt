[Intro]
(
Fuck the fire, we got grease
)
[Verse 1]
Birds of a feather flock together, gang in Goose coats
I was lil' dog, now my pape' like Manute Bol
10K a day, all blues, this a new roll (Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby)
Unky wilding, selling school buses in the school zone
Fifteen hundred on the hoodie, this some new Chrome
Fit seven thousand even when I got no shoes on
Bicep in the Backwood, this bitch too strong
Undertaker, I'll slide down, give 'em a tombstone
On the freeway, chopped up in that E-lane
Fully switch got Auto-Tune, I call it T-Pain
Three chains straight from Hutch, yours from eBay
Reach for this chain, leave 'em stretched like it's pregame
You can't slide down, you in that shooter with the cheap tires
I might burn Sam's Club down, every piece fire
Ex bitch cooked, had to leave her in the deep fryer
Four thousand on the buffalos, don't think these wires
Sundays, I should've been in church, but I was bag chasing
Someday, your time might come, you better have patience
One way up on the east side, we just Scat racing
Up pape' on some haters, leave 'em with the mad faces
Lil' gang some test dummies, they'll crash out
Something like Lamar, I end up in your stash house
It don't mean he ain't a cop just 'cause ain't no badge out
Life a gamble, I'm just on the road, could never crap out
Trackhawk, Trackhawk, shit, we finna stab out
Back to back in traffic, shit, I guess that's what they mad 'bout
Backpack Boyz, Bluegatti, finna pass out
If you ain't up a hundred, you can shut your damn mouth
High as hell, three hundred dollar meal at the Crab House
Down looking bad 'round this bitch, help your mans out
They used to talk down a lot, I heard they fans now
Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper, whipping bands out
