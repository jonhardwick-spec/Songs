[Intro]
Shit, I ain't gon’ say this the last level, but we getting there
This the next level, next chapter, the New Testament,
Bin Reaper 3
It ain't much more to say but,

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, it ain't about the shine, it’s the grind
Sometimes, it ain't gon' be yo' time, wait in line
Sometimes, it ain't about the shine, it's the grind
Sometimes, it ain't gon' be yo’ time, wait in line
You might take a hundred Ls, but the dubs be the difference
Pop a ten, I’m stuck as hell, whole time, I'm floatin’ to the distance
I remember someone askin' me, like "Tron, what make you different?"
I replied, "Without I, you can't even spell commitment"
Do you get it? Listen, I'm so fuckin’ in the mix, bro can get it
Hit it, whip it, mix it, flip a brick
Double, double Luka Troncic, you'll end with six assists
I can tell you right now, what you doin that it isn't it (Shit)
[Interlude]
Brrt, brrt, brrt
Bitch, you better not try to touch me, if you do shit gon' get ugly
If you do, shit gon' get crazy, flood yo' block like that bitch Haiti
Brrt (Huh)
You're not making this easy, Kyle (Brrt, brrt)
