Fiends on the block doin'— out some Reynolds Wrap
We with all the fuckery, we hop out tryna temple tap
How you keep gettin' robbed? Go and get a strapNiggas told me I was fallin' off, man, I needed that
Really up, hope you know that I don't need to rapIf you talkin' money, bitch, I'm everywhere you see it at
Code talkin' with my plug, shit, he say he need a month
Oh, okay, four weeks or twenty-eight, you keepin' up?
I be really gettin' money, you think that I give a fuck?Tryna get your bag right, you gotta put your feelings up
Rockin' Christian, bitch, I'm everything but holy, thoughSay they wanna see me score, but actin' like the goalie, though
On Rodeo in somе red bottoms, they on rodeo
No motion, that's disgusting, I'd rathеr slowly grow
Jeans say "from Tokyo," I'm lookin' Japanese off 'za
Frames tinted up, they don't even know I'm in here highMost wanted, ridin' with the baddest bitchI be fresh as hell and then forget to take a pic
Steppin' out the crib, can't forget to take the blickLil' brodie like a gymnast, all he know is make a flipIt's the O, I take a sip, huh, boy, this cup too dirty
(Time traveling, caught him at three, but we bust two 30s)
Whole gang blowin' money fast like the 50 Boyz
This ain't alcohol, sippin' drank, we the tipsy boys
See 12, NFL Combine, get shifty, boy
Pullin' up like Melo at the Garden, droppin' sixty, boyRecord her, feel like a director, call me Spike DeeI'm gettin' to it, I don't care 'bout who don't like me
Tryna fight me, be done blew the fingers off his fistJugg phone slappin', be done turned the ringer off this bitchUnky, he addicted, sippin' by the liter out this bitch
