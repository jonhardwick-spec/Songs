[Intro]
Ha, yeah
I had to tell Mark to adlib it
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
Ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
You worried 'bout that little shit, I'm thinking 'bout the bigger picture
At the Lab, catch me on the Nine where it hit Dequindre
I got her in my palm, finna play her like a fidget spinner
You ain't shot shit, at the most, you're a pistol whipper
RIP lil' Chris, three years later, still might drop a tear
Granddad was scoring in the city back with Bob Lanier
The Backwoods fucking with my teeth, might have to cop veneers
One thing that I can put on God, it's only God I fear
Walking out Revive, your pape' little, you can't shop in here
My bitch rеally litty, just spent twenty on Gabbana gear
Hеllcats, Trackhawks, nah, it is not a Honda near
How the fuck you struggle? You ain't even have Obamacare
Feel like Blade back up in the day, bitch, I'm a stack master
Take a swig up out my double cup, so I might nap after
This life shit a book, might write one before my last chapter
You spent all your money tryna fit in, boy, you ass backwards
Caught him in LA in a Mercedes, but my Lam' faster
Smoking Cookie in the Wonderland, I feel like Mad Hatter
I ain't in the mountains or the kitchen, I'm a jack stacker
I be dolo, I can't trust a bitch, they all be backstabbers
At the strip living life, eating lamb, throwing cash
Been grinding for three seasons, so this summer, I'ma show my ass
Used to laugh, seen 'em out and asked 'em where the jokes was at
Gone but not forgotten, made a killing off of Joker's Stash
Acting bad, spent two thousand on a coat in Saks
Out the way chilling, plotting on a M, just smoking thrax
You a ball hogger, brodie open, I'ma throw the pass
If it's smoke, like a three five, I'ma blow his ass
Pretty bitch with white acrylic nails with the toes to match
Cutting up in Bloomingdale's, then fucked around and broke a rack
I see a M right in front of me, that's where my focus at
The way these hoes attracted to the cheese, I just know they rats
First thing she do that I don't like, I throw her in a blender
Poured a whole pint last summer, woke up in December
She used to ho me, now she in my likes, I hope the ho remember
Light skin with that water, I don't think the ocean wetter
It's 2021, it's too much money, how you still poor?
Rap star, I think it's time to go and cop a billboard
Shit really hit me just performing at The Fillmore
Something like that statue in New York, I got the real torch
