Huh, lil' slut, I been turnt
Punch all day, now my fists hurt
Two cards, which one gon' hit first?
Goddamn, boy, watch this bitch skrrt
Ho asking me what my fit worthI just want the head, lil' bitch, do yo lips work?
Scam another granny, I'm a big jerkI been hitting stores all day, this my fifth clerk
Man, don't get put on life support
Hit an opp from his blindside, feel like Michael Oher
Had a ball with the slides, swiped the LordTryna fight a thirty clip? Boy, you gon' fight the Lord
I ain't Tay B but this all factsHunnid round on the chop, that's where my balls at
Mitchell & Ness, bitch, you all cap
Made yo bitch eat calamari off my ballsack
Main bitch do the Matrix, told her fall backBought the jam pack off the site but they all smack
My shooter got Air Forces on and they all blackNo cap, boy, I got some in this backpack
If it's up then it's stuck, I failed physics
Hit the two-step when I seen the mail shipped
Bitch asked for a hand, I don't sell mintsCooking up with the fire, Hell's Kitchen
She see us together, I don't, I'm Ray CharlesNigga tryna rap battle, nigga, this ain't 8 Mile
Got a real-ass chop for that fake smile
Thinking you a ape in that BAPE? Boy, you ain't wild
Cha Cha with the clerk, I'ma slideSkating in the Scat, buckle up if you ride
Turn around, let me hit it from the sideWant you and yo friend, really can't decide
No cap, really getting active, man
In Rush Hour, cutting up like I'm Jackie Chan
Bro said he can't perp but his Fanta canI'll slide down with them canons, Camera Man
We be grabbing jacks off the family planStop acting like you tough, you a family man
Fight? You better come with a backup plan
Fit European but the chop came from Pakistan
Caught the sniffles, I was riding with the coldest bitchFeel like Houdini, hit a ham with the oldest trick
Fucking with this big booty bitch, almost broke my dickWorry 'bout my roll, I ain't worried 'bout the coldest fit
Damn near broke the brick
Play tee on, you can't tell I'm emotionless
Pulled up looking for a fight, found hopelessnessHeard her hands bisexual, I'll fold a bitch
Sleep OT, getting money in my dreamsLil' bitch like my drawers, tryna get in my jeans
Something like a point guard, pass her to the team
I'm the Punch God, bitch, I'ma grab her for the free
Bitch, bend it over, I'ma stab like ScreamOn the 'Gram getting head while I'm laughing at memes
Scam star, bitch got me stiff-arming fiendsYou don't really get no money, think you boycotting cheese
