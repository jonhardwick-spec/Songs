[Intro]
Someone has broken into the national bankThe Federal ReserveThe mysterious group Anonymous has struck again with a warning
[Verse 1: OBN Dev]
I'm doing all my crimes anonymous, I got a VPN
I could pull up to the club, I'm underage but they gon' let me in
We gon' have to bring the choppa out of state if shit get out of hand
I could go and get a fire piece today and make a couple bands
Don't nobody wanna buy from me 'cause they know I scam
I just hit the road with fire BINs, I'm linking up with Stan
Almost started shooting with my Glock but it's another fan
I'm finna go and buy a money counter, I don't like my hands
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Ayy, BIN fire, nah, for real, that's on God and 'em
Big shitting, big shitters 'round me, I'm with Tron and 'em
Walking in my closet, you done walked out the continent
Think I'm playing in the NHL, I'ma slide with sticks
X on my back, walk around like I'm a treasure map
Think he finna duck, we gon' hit him where his feathers at
Back in ninth grade Foamposites had the weather map
Glocky on us, bop sticks too, we don't ever lack
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Since you riding foreign, I'ma pull up, knock the
Ruccis
off you
Bougie than a bitch, might get buried in a Gucci coffin
We'll wrap him up, let it sing, up the Toosii on him
Real life Tony
, fuck around and up the Uzi on him
Pushing EDDs, punching kicks at the same time
Linked up with Dev, take the reader down to KY
Dee quarantined and just sent twenty over FaceTime
Thinking he a ape, .223 hit his BAPE
