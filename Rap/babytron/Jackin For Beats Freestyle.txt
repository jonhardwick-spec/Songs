[Verse]
The only thing you good for is playin' roles, Kevin Spacey
Bitch got some super brain, she tryna educate me
Thought he got a zipperooni, it was seven eighthies
Walk into the ring with your bitch, I'm finna Devin Haney
Both mines' froze, you got bare wrist
You might get a rare reward if you take some rare risk
Overdid the Quag', I'm stuck like a bare brick
Dude out here smoochin' bitches that I wouldn't dare kiss
You hear me barkin', it's the DSM
Put a button on the Glock then put a opp on CNN
R.I.P. Bеn Frank', I really miss my BFF
Whole family got sauce likе we TSF
The way we live in, you would probably think we BMF
Red beam, blue beam, shit, he in the EMS
How the fuck I feel it noon and it ain't P.M. yet?
Hey, hey, hey
You ain't a demon, though
Sippin' all that green, I bet you turn into a Chia Pet
DJ Tron, shit, we the best
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, you know what's goin' on
