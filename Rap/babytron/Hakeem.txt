Yeah
[Verse 1: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
She just tryna fuck me 'cause I'm havin' money
I hit my knees and I thank God because I'm havin' motion
I done got cool with the plug, he'd probably front a hundred
You just be rappin' 'bout the bag, ain't never moved nothin'
I'm sippin' drank like my nose runnin', this an eight
If I ain't had nothin', I'll have to take the food off your plate
Tryin' the TRX, I'm in SRT, we finna race
We left our main hoes at home and took the city girls on a date
I like Tris', I love Wock', I don't really fuck with Quagen
I'm always outside with a bitch, I don't even got no lady
Nigga ever told you he did somеthin' to me? They probably laced him
I likе blowin' 'Woods back to back, Tron be facin'
Long nights, early mornings, I'm in the bank grabbin' some money
I just need you to get to runnin' while I drive us to Kentucky
I was high as hell, ended up fucking her once and now she love me
You ain't never had no money, you'd probably make a ten if you lucky
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
In my sleep, in my way, all these dreams I'ma chase
With some thieves, they'll take, long sleeve, this a Wraith
Put some cheese on his brain, what's the fee? I'll pay
Double team, I'ma fade, I'm Hakeem in the paint
Pourin' three after three, when I pee, see an eight
Why he askin' all these questions? Shit, I think he CIA
Everybody got they time, I know I'ma see my day
Walk him down, pull my mask up, I let him see my face
Shit, I'm with The GlockBoy, pass a Faygo, I'm the Wock' boy
Flashbacks of cash money, ridin' with the hot boys
Caught him out in traffic, make his whip rock like Jonboi
Dog Shit Militia, thirty foreigns, it's a convoy
You worried 'bout the front and back, go check the side door
These ain't Mike Amiris, I done switched to Who Decides War
Bean keep the metal, you would think he was cyborg
Better stop the playin', don't do nothin' you could die for
