[Verse 1: TrDee]
Thousand dollar mic, you can probably hear me think
Only face za, bougie bitch don't wanna drink
Roll full of blues, you might see a couple pink
Tryna ride the wave? I hope you ready if you sink
Okay, snow bunny, blew her back out, the [?] I salute
Told her I'm the one but always shitting like the number two
I'll ho you if the neck ain't coming, I ain't family, boo
You can leave me 'lone or by my lonely when I'm thumbing through
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Running dog shit up, the only way is towards a million
Runtz turned me to a Skywalker, got some force up in me
Shoot through whatever, feel like Kobe with the torn achilles
Catch me jack catching in yo hood, I got bored with giffies
Sleeve Nash, I'll pass this bitch, I got scorers with me
Punched the wrong size Amiris, never mind, these sorta fit me
Two thousand beans, he ain't gon' count 'em, we gon' short him sixty
I think all my opps forgot that I got the torch in Ypsi
[Verse 3: TrDee]
I'ma see a mil' before I'm fifty
I can run it up, I do it swiftly
Huh, left that nigga red, we named him "Trippie"
Incognito in the store, I'm sliding giffies
