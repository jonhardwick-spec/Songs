Stupid Dog, I ain't gon' lie, this bitch hard
)
[Verse 1: YSR Gramz]
I'm in the booth with BabyTron, he brung a Glock 9
Everybody had your bitch like Wi-Fi
Red beam on the FN like a stove light
Man, this weed strong as hell like an old Sprite
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Tuh, yeah, got dogs with me
X on my feet, lil' bitch, that's the Off-Wizzy
Hit the lil' bitch with the tuh, she was off Henny
Every gang member that I got gettin' off with me
[Verse 3: YSR Gramz]
You ain't gang-gang, you can't get off with me
Niggas tryna get a free feature to get off Whitney
Faggot-ass nigga, you should sign to Walt Disney
Bought the bag yesterday, it was gone Wednesday
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
I got the tuh and the— that put the dogs on mе
Chop with the ribbit on it, I'll put the frogs on you
Buffs with the smokе tint, look like fog on 'em
Your bitch a lil' freak, can you get her off of me?
