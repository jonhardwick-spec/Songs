It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga

[Verse 1: J1Hunnit]
Double-R with the Interstellar roof, this a dope boy dream
Monkey suit on like Arwin in the time machine
Parallel Universalizer on the side of me
I'm not a St. Lunatic, I don't need you to ride with me
Migo down to drop an eagle off for a driver's fee
Them niggas ain't havin' real chicken, they gettin' Tyson meat
Fuck what you heard, bite his ear, I Mike Tyson beef
I seen that moose knuckle at a glance, can I make you queef?
My money long, I'll buy the BBL and gastric sleeve
My bad, please excuse me if I cough and wheeze
Backwood full of kerosene, Gelato 33
Middle finger to my old friends, they not hurtin' me
[Verse 2: StanWill]
If I ain't at the crib, you know I'm blick totin'
Ain't no Henny, unky Solo cup got Tris potion
Bro like Harden, he be ballin' off the wrist motion
We gon' bake him like tilapia, we catch him fish bowlin'
Up a hundred, feel like J, this that last shit
If I ain't in your baby, you can catch me in some fast shit
Shopaholic, I hit Somerset and just grab shit
Linebackers, if we see a sack, you get your ass blitzed
Brodie keep a ski mask on like he Shaun White
Hutch pendant, type of shit that give you frostbite
Quagmire, Wock', Tris shit, we can talk pints
Unless I'm rockin' Virgil, I can never have an off night
