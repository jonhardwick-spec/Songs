[Intro: StanWill]
I could blow a— (
Okay, KMoney
), yup
[Verse 1: StanWill]
I could blow a fifty, you can't blow a five
Woke up rich as fuck today, might buy the ho revive
Killed the pussy, bet the Perc she popped done made the ho revive
See me cheatin', she gon' cry a river, I'm on Ocean Drive
She like how my diamonds glisten, bitch, I got all kind of chicken
Talkin' all that broke shit through your lips, bitch, I ain't trnya listen
New AR with telescope attached, can get him sniped from distance
Forty cracked a stilly willy-o, done took a Sprite and mixed it
Bro rock Maison off his Christian, but hе atheist
Sticked up in that oven mitt, you know wе bakin' shit
He like Madden for that sack, you know I play to blitz
Ain't 'bout how you fall, it's how you get up when you take a hit
[Verse 2: TrDee]
This shit get lethal, I can't never leave without my weapon
Touch down in the Bay, they treat me just like Stephen
Pat Bev', if I see 'em out, I gotta press 'em
Step in my closet, I can show you how to do these dresses
Shit'll never change, same crew until the end
Thinkin' 'bout this shit you did and how I took it to the chin
Thinkin' 'bout them lame niggas that be hatin' on the gang
How you up some dog shit and you don't even got a chain?
I be chillin' at the crib, feet up, not at the club
I don't think you really up if you can't show me a dub
I don't think you got what it takes, I feel like Simon Cowell
They gon' love you when you up, but who gon' be there when you down?
