What up, Rocket?
Punch me in, Mark
(
Keep that shit lowkey, Tae
) What up, Tae?
And I'm facin' eighths
I'm off an eighth, I'm fuckin' (
Rocket, you're so full of yourself
)
Hey, yeah (ShittyBoyz)
[Verse 1]
Bitch said I'm a junky 'cause I'm facing eighths and pouring fours (I'm high as hell)
Goose on the sneaks and the coat, I got golden toes (Golden)
Punch god, heavyweight champ, we can go toe to toe (Punch god)
Thirty stick hangin' out, look like a totem pole
I'll send 'em up to space, got a rocket like LaFlare (He outta there)
SB fiend, just this morning, copped another pair (Nikes)
AR family wrecking, give a fuck your brother there (Pow, pow)
Christian Loubs look like cleats, get the bag and punt it there (Christian Loubs)
If I score a touchdown, I'ma go for two (Ayy)
You talking 'bout some za, but we know it's boof (Boof)
I'm cuttin' shit at the head if I see a cobra loose
Riding 'round like the military, this how soldiers move
You won't catch me in the club, I'm probably making money
I know the opps see these two chains, come and take 'em from me (Bling)
Spilled six Os of Wockiana, left the table muddy
Life was a rainstorm, now every day be sunny (I swear)
Pape' long as hell, but I got a short temper (I swear)
Drip war, guarantee that I'ma leave the floor wetter (Drip war)
GOAT, the walking definition of them four letters
Thinking that you fly, guarantee that I got more feathers
