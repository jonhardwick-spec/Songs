[Intro]
Yeah
RIP Chris
(Ayy, J.K.)This for you lil’ bro[Verse 1]You ain’t walked in my shoes, so you can’t relate
I’m doing great, so I guess they feel the need to hate
Talking loose, I hope he know that he picked his fate
Tough now, but if I catch him out, then I bet he skate
BabyTron finna pop, I ain’t got time to wait
What’s good Lil’ Chris, I’ll catch you at the gates
Hoes used to play, spin me like a figure eight
Funny how the same goes asking can they get a date
Used to be starving, you could hear my stomach growl
Now Beni’s knows my face when I come around
In the Robins feeling fly, I ain’t coming down
That’s bro clutching on the tool, ain’t no thunder sound
Ask god why, why he take my peoples
Take one of mines, we take two, then we equal
Devil taking over, tryna walk through the evil
F&N sent his ass flying like a fucking eagle
I was down on my ass walking through the rain
But now my kicks cost a band and some fucking change
ShittyBoyz to the grave, that’s the shit I claim
Tryna take me out the game, boy you better fix your aim
I suggest you play it cool, you got a life to live
Bro will knock your shit back, he ain’t got no fucks to give
Been tryna blow off this rap since I was a kid
Team got the foreign kicks, looking like we Real Madrid (Balenciagas)
