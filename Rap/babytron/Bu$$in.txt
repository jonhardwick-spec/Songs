[Verse 1: Fordio]
I peeped they gon' play it fake, I been knew not to trust 'em
Can you please not blow my high? I told you that I'm bussin'
It's a four up in my pop, it got me moving sluggish
Been on the score since school, put down the ball, still get a bucket
My slimes got some loose screws, since a youngin, they've been clutchin'
And it's crazy, ain't no money in his pocket, he the toughest
I'm a youngin, still schooled, won't show my hand to the public
I been clearing cards [?] for the times it was the roughest
Graduated from the scams, juggs was the main subject
Out on bond, still catch me ridin' with controlled substance
Got some money, now they claim they love me all of a sudden
Got some Wocky, they ain't have the Fay, then I'ma have to Crush it
[Verse 2: Prince Jefe]
My lil' ho set the play for me, your best move not to trust her
I hit up the T's for 80 G's, I'm feeling like my uncle
I grab my blender, get the Reynold, time to bubble
Twenty jacks, I overnight 'em, this for scam
I might fuck you like you mine, baby, that don't mean I love you
Hoes fighting for a title, this shit feel like Royal Rumble
I've been shitting on my idols, all of a sudden they don't love me
Up the switch, no point in running
Quit my bitch, she ain't a hundred, in your city thuggin'
Rapping like a big dawg, but I know you wasn't
My youngin knock your shit off for a couple hundred
I'm riding with the blick, tryna put you under
I don't need a bitch, I just need a stuffer
