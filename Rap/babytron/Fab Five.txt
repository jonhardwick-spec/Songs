[Intro: StanWill]
Yeah
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Red tips, .762s, shoot a Taki at him
Good punch at Yoshi, satisfied by hibachi habit
Website surfing, tryna punch like I'm Bobby Lashley
Hundred round bop to his face, we gon' hockey mask him
Me and gang be cracking cards but unc' and them be rock slanging
Sauce I got be secret than a bitch, I be done squashed Plankton
Knock him down his ass and [?] from the [?] station
Caught him on that corner, gave him ninety like a right angle
[Verse 2: TrDee]
She won't leave me 'lone 'cause I'm the catch and she know I'm up
Tryna slide this way? We gon' hit him like a hockey puck
How'd I get his mans but not him? He a lucky fuck
Yo people don't support none of yo music 'cause they know you suck
Computer thugs, you won't see me going back and forth
Could've went and bought yo bitch some hair but I bought a shirt
They ain't really see us going far, I know some niggas hurt
I'ma keep making niggas sick until I'm in the dirt
[Verse 3: YSR Gramz]
Oh, you spent all yo money? Nigga, how that work?
I know a bitch with some ass, she don't know how to twerk
I'll put the whole world on you like I'm Lil Durk
My nigga really a hot boy like he lil' Turk
I front that madman, told him he got to pay me on the first
How you out here killing niggas and you used to jerk?
This nigga off a Seroquel, he ain't off a Perc'
We'll take yo mans from you, put him on a shirt
