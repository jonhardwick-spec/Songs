[Chorus: BabyTron]
Boy, your whole lifestyle damn near bottom tier
Take an L and bounce back, you'll drop a tear
11 minutes after 11, I hope some Wock appear
Widebody Range, go out the way tryna dodge some deer
Boy, your whole lifestyle damn near bottom tier
Take an L and bounce back, you'll drop a tear
11 minutes after 11, I hope some Wock appear
Widebody Range, go out the way tryna dodge some deer
[Verse 1: Fordio]
Shit, finna land in the Bay, I hope some drop here
Pour a dirty ass 4, throwing up the cheers
Bro had thе jakes in the mirror, cars getting clеared
Fordi quick to leave her line, now she call me weird
[Verse 2: MJ Paid]
Walk in the [?] gonna face your fears
Niggas belk, I can tell, you ain't ate in years
I know a nigga who can fuck around and tap gears
We on y'all ass, how the fuck you lookin' in that mirror?
[Interlude: $camaurion]
Shit, we ain't at a show but I'll still give you the drac' experience
War torn, I'll hit a couple states, you still on yo' pivot
Ham thought it was a jugg cuz I said I'll ship it
