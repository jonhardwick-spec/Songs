[Intro: StanWill]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
(
Danny G on the beat
)
Let us get the drop, we gon' rob the spot
Let us get the drop, we gon' rob the spot
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Let us get the drop, we gon' rob the spot
Fire on my waist, but my neck cold as HÃ¤agen-Dazs
Ain't no squashin' beef, we gon' squash the opps
Mirror tint the buffs, ain't no way we seein' eye-to-eye
She gon' blow me like a 'Wood 'cause I'm lit
Reach for anything, I wish a nigga would in this bitch
She an eater, I put wood to her lips
If we get the lo' at four, I'm in his hood when it's six
[Verse 2: TrDee &
BabyTron
]
Drop fifty on his block just like Shaq, bitch
Why the fuck they still sleepin' on me like a mattress?
Ballin' on who left me out to dry like a cactus
You don't know us, huh? Must live under a rock, Patrick
Can you stop hattin'?
Spot jump like Josh Jackson
I just got a case of yeah, shit, I'm livin' Wocktastic
You can't even set the play on me, I'm John Madden
I'ma wear this bitch with every 'fit, the Glock  fashion
Switchin' up drip, but nah, I ain't never switchin' teams
