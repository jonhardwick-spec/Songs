[Intro]
(
AJ, you play too much
)
Ayy, ayy
[Chorus]
In a two-seater, just me and my bitch
When I drop her off, shit, it's just me and my switch
Sold a ten out the pint, so it's just me and my six
We gon' need a hundred M's, just me and my kin
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me, myself, and I
You gotta tune out everything from 'round you, let yourself decide
Should've knew to trust my gut, this shit was off, I felt the vibe
Life a movie, only thing about it, it ain't televised
[Verse]
We gon' pull up, pop out of that Ghost and leave 'em petrified
Junkie turned his zombie on, he noddin' off a second line
Have you ever took the same L for a second time?
When life knock you down, you gotta give a second try
Spin they block in Model X's, call that shit electric slide
Audemars Piguet is fully bust, I gotta guess the time or gotta check my phone
Been scratched the first ones off, I gotta set my goals
Wake up and pour a deuce of red to reset my soul
Bitch head so weak, didn't even bend my toes
Plug bullshittin', text his phone, go 'head, send my load
He been in the game longer than me, had to respect my coach
Dudey actin' like a fiend, he might as well come test my dope
When it's war, you ain't gon' shoot, you just gon' run around
Watch out, let me play the quarterback, you just go run a route
You ain't gon' do a damn thing, you just gon' fuckin' pout
You just gon' run yo' mouth, alright, now run them pockets
Somewhere out of town in my buggy, spendin' munyun, shoppin'
Been knew he was bummy, ninth grade was rockin' fucked up Robins
Work at McDonald's or a Wendy's, you got fucked up options
Prefer some head with my red, I'm gettin' sucked up, noddin'
See you blowin' squares, young dog, you need to puff-puff stop it
Had to call my lil' ho phone 'cause I just puff-puff dropped it
You is not the plug, and if you is, you got some fucked up socket
Please stop rappin' 'bout a dub, the whole time, you got fucked up pockets
You the type to fuck up profits
We was clockin' in and out, we ain't just luck up plottin'
Quarter ticket on me, MIA, I'm finna fuck up Collins
Doggy had a couple guns and still died, he fucked up swappin'
Thought that all the snakes was out the picture, but I fucked up croppin'
Told your titi that we out of work, like shut the fuck up knockin'
I told
Beannskii
if he run up, drop 'em
If we get the drop, can catch me out the window, bust up, poppin'
Open up my geek kit in the booth and generate some bars
All that bein' loose up in that coupe, got detonate his car
Outer-space, I think I'm finna spend an extra day on Mars
First, you gotta push the separation, elevate from far
Don't even think to call me son, we not in New York
Been fucked up the beef, I think we need some new forks
Twenty loose leafs a day, you think these bitches Newports
You been gettin' fluke intel, you need a new source
2024, Tyrannosaurus, plus the new Porsche
Scored a sixty in my Who Decides War, not hoop shorts
Need to tat an L up on yo' face 'cause you a true dork
Shit, if ballin' was a crime, I still wouldn't find a new sport
You prayin' on a new life? I love mine
Sometimes, the sky is cloudy, sometimes, the sun shines
That's just life, you know?
When it knocks you down, you gotta get up, fight, you know?
