[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Fuck the fire, we got grease
)
Gang came a long way, what can I say?
(
It's BlueStrip, baby
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
If you see me hopping on a flight, just know it's first class
(Huh, nah, for real, it don't matter where I'm going)
If see me hopping on a flight, just know it's pape' OT
Six of Quagy-agy, you can't tell the Faygo cream
I got fire plastic on me, I ain't pay no cheese
Why you at the light squealing? You can't race on E
(Shaking my motherfucking head)
Boy, I'ma leave you at the light
Smacked off a pint, Jesus Christ, I might crash tonight
Throw us in the Hall of Fame (Swish)
Half-court, full court, shit, I'm calling gang
Turn the blender on on any bitch 'cause they be all the same
Forty pointers in my Cartiers, thеse bitches cost a chain
I had to frost the framеs
Two Glockies, I'm just dual wielding
SBDSM, we need a few million
Tried to put a limit on us? They gon' need a new ceiling
Hit him with a green tip, it ain't no way that dude healing, huh
[Verse 2: TrDee]
It's gon' hurt you when you cannot get a hold of me
Why would I beef with you? You only known locally
He was talking real hard, we finna go and see
Need a ride or die that's even 'round if you low on E
Out in Cali riding 'round with the roof gone
In the room with six bitches like a group home
Fuck, I might just do the dash tryna get home
SBDSM
, put it on my headstone
I can't trade teams, I understand how Dame feel
All she do is give it up, how do she got a brain still?
If we hit you with that blick, you cannot go and find S.H.I.E.L.D
Unc' a junkie, up at 2 AM pouring lines still
All you hear is "What the fuck is that?" when I'm passing by
If you ain't down to blow that bitch, man, pass the Glock
You saw your mans wide open but ain't pass the rock
Rich, bad bitch, only thing she like to do is shop
