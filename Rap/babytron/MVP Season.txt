[Intro]
Ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
I let her hit the za two times, had her tapping out
The beef ain’t dead until you dead, nah, we can’t scrap it out
Bro got three zips and a dream, tryna trap it out
Road runner, 'fore I hit the South, I gotta map it out
Was never finna lollygag I’m on the fully active route
Stab on yo bitch, run out the crib and then I’m stabbing out
You spent yo last on that jokes up, what is to laugh about?
You can’t pick on me, I’m in the foreign with the gadget now
Fourteen hundred dollar kicks, I got expensive habits now
I used to rock whatever up to school, my fit be matching now
I ain’t never sold a gram of crack, I took the scamming route
This a big-ass .30 clip, you took the standard route
Couple thou' a day off PUA so I be cashing out
The same dude talking like the plug, I heard he lagging out
HD quality up on the whip when I be backing out
Better back-back, bitch, I hit pedestrians
I been horsing opp, shit, I should’ve did equestrian
You ain’t sloppy with the head, bitch, bring yo bestie then
You a cool guy, up a ticket and impress me then
Pop from Korea with the Wock', these exotic swigs
As-salamu alaykum with habibi, we don’t rock with pigs
Don't disrespect me, you won't never catch me [?]
Zipped bag season, I told brodie go and hop in his
Ha-ha, yeah, it's the zipped baggy season
On 96, we big tripping, zigzagging Demons
You might have a money phone but my shit actually beeping
Somerset my second home, I spend big racks in Neiman's
Just a warning, I'm a shit talking flashy motherfucker
Intoxicated off a four, might crash this motherfucker
Chain water, that's yo ass, you tried to snatch this motherfucker
ShittyBoyz, we shitting on the opps, go ask them motherfuckers
Mark tripped on the beat, I spent six on my sneaks
Ten deep in Goose coats, we flocking in this bitch like geese
Gave the lil' bitch Perky work, I had to switch my tee
If the bag right in South Dakota, take the shit on feet
When I drop "Luka Trončić", they gon' hit repeat
Bitch used to spin so if she calling, hit her with the beep
Out of town dripping sauce and my lil' bitch on fleek
If it's smoke, we gon' blow his ass, boy, he Swisher sweet
Knocked his top off, we done left the opp incomplete
I just popped that one thang, now I got that itch in me
Bro off Wock' in his Triple S, catch him triple Z's
Crazy that a baldhead done turned him into Mr. Clean
I just wanna thank my scam fam, boy, this BIN so heat
Dre blew like eighty on his watch, got his wrist on freeze
Doing doughnuts in a Hellcat, this ain't Krispy Kreme
Bro lying to his PO, talking 'bout his system clean
