[Verse 1: Oba Rowland]
Why y'all believe these niggas?
I don't even wanna see these niggas
I never wanna be these niggas
I'm in the coupe, finna leave these niggas
I'm in the mood, tryna see who with it
After we do it, act like we ain't did it
This dick, she immediately miss it, huh
Yo bitch gon' need new extensions, huh
F&N, I don't need no extension, huh
If you owe me, you don't get no extension, huh
Papa told me get a job with a pension, no
I'm a motherfucking star and I'm finna glow
In a motherfucking car where the engine roar
I'm the plug, you a fucking extension cord
RIP [?] you know that I miss you, boy
RIP Dex, you know that I miss you, boy
RIP [?], you know that I miss you, boy
We some legends on the West, do yo history, boy, yeah
We some legends over here, do yo history, boy
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Posted up on the West,
Rube Goldberg
Jumped in head first, wasn't no air
ShittyBoyz broke? That's like me with no hair
Every time my boys hit the road, I say a long prayer
Made five, it ain't even three o'clock
Bro say he can't feel his soul off the three of Wock'
Bet you bro'll make his soul vanish if he see a opp
Like a fat Japanese nigga, know I keep the chop
