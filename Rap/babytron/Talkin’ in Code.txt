[Intro: KrispyLife Kidd]
(
I got so much Enrgy
)
Okay
I got a lot of, okay, KrispyLife, it's with a what? Okay
[Verse 1: KrispyLife Kidd]
You and your bitch keep lying, you got a capiana
Shot dog and heard chains fall, that mean I dropped a dollar
We was on bullshit growing up, y'all played cops and robbers
Dog ain't wanna fill the script, so I robbed the doctor
That shit was so crucial
I can't sell nothing but Zaza Pachulia
I just fucked a bitch my auntie age, I love my cougar
I thought you was rookie Rondo, you is not no shooter
[Verse 2: 10kKev]
Cop a pack from me, bring it to you like a waiter
Put a hole in that nigga, turn him to a Life Saver
Just scammed this nigga in the NFL, he on the Raiders
Out of all the hoes I fucked, I think yours is my favorite
Nine-fifty for the LV polo with the zipper
How is five niggas putting on a ten-dollar bottle of liquor?
That's two dollars a piece
I just hit your bitch at your crib and nutted on your sheets
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Why the fuck is niggas switchin' sides?
Shoe soles bloody than a bitch, I'm finna slip and slide
Fuck the holidays, bitch, I really got this gift from God
If you talking 'bout niggas who shittin', better mention mine
Bitch, we up next for real
Had to buy some thousand-dollar shoes 'cause I step for real
Fuck DJ Khaled, me and gang, we the best for real
Catch him out of bounds, bro'll blow, he a ref for real
