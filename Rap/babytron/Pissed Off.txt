[Intro]
(
1WayKay, you went off on this bitch
)
Yeah, huh
Fuck around and drop the top on the coupe
Ayy, yeah, yeah
[Verse]
Fuck around, and drop the top on the coupe, ayy
7.62s, tryna knock him out his shoes, ayy
Reach for this chain? Fuck around and make the news, ayy
Reach for this chain? Quickest way to get you blew, ayy
Ten toes, bitch, I'm standing on them till the day I'm gone
Would've thought the Glock was full of Runtz, we done made him float
ShittyBoyz BabyTron, she choosing if they play a song
Secure the bag, OT, I'm finna take it home
I'm the Punch King, you cannot take my throne
This some creed, hundred dollars when I spray cologne
I don't even know you, why the fuck is you hating, bro?
Pissed in the club, finna make the strippers rake the floor
Stuffing dick in this bitch mouth, I'm tryna break her throat
Would've thought my parents wasn't human, they done made a GOAT
Wintertime, I'ma throw some money up and make it snow
(Every time you shoot, you miss yo shot, that's why yo rating's low)
Every time you shoot, you miss yo shot, that's why yo rating's low
In the trenches iced up, shit, forgot I'm famous, bro
Let a clown think shit sweet, we gon' paint his nose
Margiela stepping, if I trip, I might paint the floor
One man army but I ride around with six weapons
Do the dash and swing the widebody, it might get hectic
Unky in the kitchen, cost a band for a wrist lesson
Done selling sauces, 10K just for six methods
Ten thousand dollar fit on, walk around through the opp shit
Huh, they won't touch me though
Half sleep flying off some Wock', I'm just chilling in the cockpit
Huh, I just drunk a four
I can switch it up, they missing shit, they blickies glitching up
I can't have a bitch around me if she on some iffy stuff
I'll have this .9 flying at you like when Iggy jump
Bitch tryna ride me like a horse, I told her giddy up
You still got a ten? You need to get it up
Wock' party, you need five hundred, tryna hit a cup
Bob Marley, I'ma face this bitch, you can't hit my blunt
Chopstick, swing around and doot if he feeling tough
Huh, took his Cartis, he was feeling buff
Ex bitch losing, seen her out looking hit as fuck
Mike Amiri newest season, make it hard to drip with us
Pedal pushing in my Triple S's, finna triple up
Keep a hammer like I'm Triple H
Wednesday, two o'clock, I'm at Fleming's getting steak
Everything heavy, bitch, you playing with some little pape'
Everything heavy, bitch, you playing with some lil' weight
I was fucked up, they seen me hungry, they can't get a plate
12 flicked me, like, I hope they know I'm finna get away
Remember being fucked up, was praying for a bigger play
Bitch, I know you see my chain, I'm looking like the shit today
Why the ugly hoes always instigate?
Ugly roll, bitch talk loose? Up it in her face
Been in my bag, you zipped your zipper late
Brodie caught a body in the foreign, finna switch the plates
