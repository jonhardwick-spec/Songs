[Intro]
Yeah, I made six figures this winter in my Timberlands
Yeah, huh
I ran up six figures this winter in my Timberlands
Huh, yeah, huh
[Verse]
I ran up six figures this winter in my Timberlands
Backhand a bitch for backtalking, where's yo discipline?
If the quarterback get it off, shit, we gon' blitz again
Cutting up in the booth, ain't bring a pair of scissors in
Off a Perc' 30 in the coupe, bitch, I got road rage
I live a fast brakes lifestyle on a slow day
My hitman'll blow you, I just hit the mall and blow pape
Dick sucking-ass gon' ride the wave till yo boat break
Two thousand dollars kicks for no reason, I just had to do 'em
Oh, you need a zip? Then pull up, I'ma tax you, stupid
Woke up high as hell, shotgun, we on Mack and Bewick
And if they ever get me in that room, bitch, I'm acting clueless
Camp around the corner in a rental till the mail comes
'Cat faster than a cheetah, oh, yo whip a snail, huh?
Got my bitch twisting eighthies up with her nails done
Talking 'bout some smoke, can you please just inhale some?
We different, you'll roll a gram, I'm a three five chief
We different, this a V12, that's a 3.5 litre
We different, way before the EDD, I had the swipe fever
Delta first class, I'm a real life sightseer
How I act now, that's how I acted then
With the Men in Black and best believe they got the gadgets in
Dawg said he horsed me? Someone please throw a cap to him
Yeah, it's cool to shoot but sometimes you gotta pass to win
Boy blocked me from his bitch 'Gram but I bet I fuck
Getting good head at 4 AM like, "How the hell I'm up?"
Drop a deuce of Wock', for a band, I'll sell my cup
7.62s big as fuck, could flip a semi truck
Bitch, I'm jacked up like a car with a flat tire
Yeah, you might ball a little bit but my stats higher
You looking crazy at the self-scan, I only jam fire
Half of me love the fast life, the other half tired
If I see the opps, I'm ten toes, ain't gotta juke up in me
I keep nodding off 'cause I got a deuce of juice up in me
Big exotic 'Woods, Giant Fuyu, ain't no hookah in me
White boy'll pass the play to gang, that's the Luka in me
My hitman cheap, he sliding in a Taurus with a torch
Shit talker, when the beat come on, I ignore the chorus
Sleepy head, man, I fucked around and poured a four, I'm snoring
Soaring in the Trackhawk, it's roaring, bitch, watch me floor it
You don't know shit if you really think that girl yours
Sick of broke hoes, if I see one, I'ma hurl towards her
My one, yeah, know who she is, I give the world to her
Four years ago was upping giffies on a world tour
Walk in closet full of drip, it look like Narnia
Chopstick got more shots on it than a party bus
Boy, I thought you hardbodied, why the fuck yo Cartis tucked?
You gon' hear a "swish" every time, better guard me up
