[Intro]
Uh
Ayy
Huh (
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
[Chorus]
Us against the whole human race, bitch, we aliens
Four figure coat, can't you see this bitch Canadian?
Bitch want some dick?
I'ma charge her like LaDainian
Hutch chains got me freezing like I'm Scandinavian
Dubs, fifties, blue strip hunnids, ain't no ones or fives
Zombie off the Wocky, pop a RP and come alive
'Hawk in the winter, Hellkitty for the summertime
Waiting in yo bushes, take too long and I'ma (Yeah, come inside)
[Verse 1]
Rocked his ass to bed, Glockiana sung a lullaby
Akhi sliding
with a rocket launcher, RondoNumbaNine
Tronalations 1:1, you cannot fuck with I
Deuce or better, can't remember last time I drunk a line
I been scamming since the I-6
Life lit, off of shit talking got a ice kit
Five thousand dollar fit, when I walk, I drip
Living on the edge, pray for me 'cause I might slip
Catch me hopping out, old pape', pistol newest gen'
Pretty bitch, her attitude the meanest, she the rudest ten
EDD finished, unky fucking with the food again
Drop topping, fuck the death threats, come and do it then
Been had it, been scamming, been jamming, been active
Every time dawg in the studio, he big capping
Whip fast, on the interstate zig-zagging
Spent a day on the opps' block and ain't shit happened
