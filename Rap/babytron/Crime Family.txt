[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Unky get the girl off before the boy because it's ladies first
Bitch called me broke, must not know what the AP worth
Balenciagas with the LEDs, they cost me eighty Percs
Remember hoopin' in them shoes, ain't fit, aw, man, them KDs hurt
[Verse 2: Overlord Scooch]
Overlords, crime family, we the Colleonis
Posted on some other nigga's block, but we rolling on it
Getting money mandatory, we don't stand or loiter
'Cause it's disrespectful to the gangstas that done camе before us
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
What I threw up in thе club, I could've paid your mortgage
Lost control off the Quagen, I can't aim the foreign
When I'm in the booth, you better sponge, 'cause it's game I'm pouring
Pouring drank, cup storming off an eight, I'm snoring
[Verse 4: Overlord Scooch]
Old-school I'm working on got a scary motor
Niggas wearing fake watches, that's what Gary told us
Pulled up in a short Escalade, call it Gary Coleman
Mask on, mixing up that fetti, we ain't scared of COVID
[Verse 5: BabyTron]
Kitchen full of ice, but the spot is hotter than Arizona
All that ancient drip that you be rocking, might as well wear a toga
We ain't passing 'Woods, we ain't sharing sodas
Lil brodie got some Motioneaze, meet him on Saratoga
