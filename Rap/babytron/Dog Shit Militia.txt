[Intro: StanWill]
Huh, ayy, what up, Getta? (

)
Like, damn, I can't get a beat, man?
Ayy
Huh, ayy, look me in my, yeah, huh, ayy
Look me in my, yeah, huh, ayy
Huh, ayy, yeah
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Look me in my eyes, huh, yeah
Look me in my eyes, oh, you can't, buffs limousine
Scam season, I done came Tech, fuck a skinny jean
I wish he would reach for my chain, feel like Timmy T
Like, I wish he would, bitch, I'm Timmy Turner
If I'm anywhere without my gang then I'm with a burner
Yo bitch give me small fry vibes 'cause she with a burger
And tell my old bitch, "Like some pics when you finish lurking"
Yeah, check the Apple Watch, ain't no time for hoes
Like we OT with the strip, got all kind of poles
Gang caught his ass off-guard, ain't have time to pose
Bro rolling three hoes with him like he tryna bowl
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Been getting, yeah, okay, yeah
Been getting jacks, you can call me "Tronny Appleseed"
Tryna run off? I'ma point the shotty at your feet
I'm a real rapper, you ain't ate hibachi at the beach
Three-five a hunnid dollars, y'all gon' probably match a G
Magpul grip, big scope, and attached a beam
I eat ramen all week just to stack some cheese
Mad as fuck this bitch ain't let me fuck like I ain't actually me
Like I ain't actually him
Why would you start a war with us like you'd actually win?
Fucked her off some bundles and I got them off of smacking BINs
Slam dunk, I'ma bend her over and attack her rim
