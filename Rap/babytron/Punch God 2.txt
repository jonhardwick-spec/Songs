[Verse]
Woke up thinking like I need more pape’ (Huh?)
I wouldn't save a bitch in a VLONE cape (I wouldn't)
At J Ally’s pissed, ain't no T-bone steak (Fuck)
Thinking that you wet in that pre-owned BAPE? (Lame)
I dropped Wilt twelve times on the shoes
So when I'm in the casket, make sure I'm in the Loub's (Christian's)
Cheat code activated, ain't no way to lose (Lose)
I'm running up a check like I got some weight to lose
I told the bitch she got my heart but I don’t got one (Haha)
Pretty bitch let me hit before I dropped one
Up on the opps, I’ma score and let the clock run (Brrah)
Chop like a Newport, if it's smoke, I’ma pop lungs
Fuck the past, it don't matter what it was (It don't)
I
been big up, I wanna jugg just because
(I do)
Light-years ahead of y'all, feeling like I’m
Buzz
(Fyoom)
We met one time, you got the nerve to call me cous'? (What?)
That shit crazy, spinning hoes like the Hokey Pokey (Spinner)
Every time I drop a song, I see them goat emojis (Huh?)
Acting tough so when you see me out, you 'posed to show me
Stop flashing sticks, shoot that bitch since you 'posed to blow me
But you ain't, you a bitch and you know it (Lame)
Actions speak louder than words so I'ma show it (Yeah)
She looked me in my eyes and said, “BabyTron, you goated”
Almost nutted in her mouth, bitch took me out my focus (What the fuck?)
She said, "It don't look like you swipe," that's the whole point (It is)
You worried 'bout a Scat, bitch, I'm coming Rolls Royce (Skrrt, skrrt)
Jumped in my bag like I ain't have no choice
Runtz beating ass, boy, I ain't got no time to smoke joints (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, what?)
Your hoes through, huh, I'm talking finished (Haha)
T
hey said I look like Drake Bell, bitch, I'm still tripping (I am)
They praying that I lose, look, bitch, I'm still winning (I am)
Count my blessings everyday but I'm still sinning
Light skin bitch from the 'Ville and her head great (Goddamn)
I'm talking A-plus, bitch made my legs shake (Woo)
I'm a hundred like a twenty plus ten eights
BAPE wet as hell, I remember rocking Red Ape
Every bitch that doubted me gon' regret it
Looked at the sky and told God that's where I'm headed (To the top)
If I get online and grab a punch, it's a debit (Punch)
If I send that bitch in the store, it's some credit (Slide)
Nike Tech, could give a fuck about a fit
Jack after jack, could give a fuck about a brick (Jack)
Ten bands on me, give a fuck about some drip
Jammed and I slide, could give a fuck about some pit (Woo-hoo)
Had her tapping out like I know jiu-jitsu
You can't hit this 'Wood, boy, it's gon' hit you (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
If I was broke like y'all, I'd be pissed too
Feel like Vin Diesel, hit the block then I drift through (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)
I gave a bitch my heart and she threw it in the dirt (Huh?)
If it ain't the truth, I won't put it in a verse (I won't)
Feel like Undertaker, I'll throw 'em in a hearse
Left the bitch sick, I need to throw her to a nurse (Sick)
I ain't playing checkers, I was taught to play chess (I was)
Ain't nobody in this bitch looking like a threat (Nah)
Lead in this Glock, I'ma put 'em to the test
Heart on my t-shirt, wish I could put it in my chest (Brr-pow, pow, pow, pow, pow)
I'm on yo' ass, that's for everyone ahead of me (Huh?)
Wouldn't care if you was
DTE, fuck yo' energy
(Bitch)
Swear you hard bodied, got female tendencies
Fendi belt looking like the grade I got in chemistry (F's)
Fuck Call Of Duty, brodie on a kill streak (Brrah-bah)
Want to be my wife but she just a lil' freak
Got his first pair of Yeezy's, now doggy feel sweet (Ayy)
ShittyBoyz what?
I swear to God y'all kill me (Lame)
I'd still stand out if I was laying down (Stand out)
Super sense, I can smell when it's a play around
First time I loaded up, I was playing 'round
Feel like Clyde Drexler with the slides, bitch, I'm blazing now (Woo)
Twenty-eight waist, the Glock can't fit 'cause they skinny (Brrah-bah)
Bro shoot like Curry, walk away, do the shimmy
Talking 'bout cuffing? LOL, bitch, you silly (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, lame)
It's Tron now, bitch, cut it out with the Jimmy
