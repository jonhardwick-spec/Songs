[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
Walking like a zombie off this four of Wock', I'm half, yeah
Huh, yeah
Huh
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Walking like a zombie off this Wocky, bitch, I'm half sleep
Ran it up like a athlete, I got fast feet
Talking loose on the 'net gon' get yo mans beat
Leaving Cali, back to the crib to where the gas be
[Verse 2: StanWill]
I can't even shop no more 'cause all the fans harass me
Skinny Mike Amiris, hidden in 'em where the MAG be
Tell a bitch if she ain't got a bag then she can't bag me
She gon' blow mе with her pinky out, I swear she classy
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Yеah, that's yo bitch but she wishing that she had me
Run it up till I'm old with a bad knee
I don't trust hoes, just my gang and my family
If balling was a crime then apprehend me

White buffaloes with mirror tint, look like a damn geese
7.62s'll kill your baby like a Plan B
Riding 'round with tint, a hunnid shots up in Stan Jeep
