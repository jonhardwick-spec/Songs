[Chorus]
Lil' brodie stealing everything, Ricky Henderson
(Go do your research, you gotta learn somethin' 'fore you listen)
I'll fuck around and push that button, have the blicky blender him (Brr)
Five thousand dollar fit, that's fifty Benjamins (Brr)
[Verse 1]
Really connected to the plug, yo' shit be renderin'
Dog $hit Militia, unky in his Dickies sellin' it
Periodic table in the kitchen, sixty elements
Let me see an opp, gon' lose control like Missy Elliott
(Boom)
I'm in that G-Wagon (Skrrt)
G-O-D, if I see twelve, I'ma keep stabbin' (Skrrt)
Why you acting like a vet'? You ain't seen action
I ain't dealing with the fishy shit, won't even eat salmon (Goddamn)
Since he cappin', we gon' put three in his hat like Chance the Rapper
I don't think yo team could get a victory, yo' mans a slacker
Retired 201s, I'm walkin' in to cash them bastards
Twelve terabytes, I baked a pie, I'm a Apple jacker
In high school, you thought you had life figured out
But now you just an average Joe, you took the five figure route
It's 2022, it's time to throw the Swishers out
Land shopping out in Texas, I might need a bigger house
All these motherfuckin' Track .2s, I could write a book
Lil' brodie, he ain't got no Ls, he finna slide on foot
Fly as hell, fuck what's underneath me, I'm too high to look
Had to pat him down for a wire, he actin' like the hook
Spin the block and pop his top like a corkscrew (Brr)
A killer on the 'Gram but he be singing in the courtroom (Man)
All I'm missin' is a saddle, we done horsed you
Bandana patches wrapped around my jeans, it ain't no horse shoes
Sippin' out a baby bottle, all I'm missing is a pacifier
(Wah)
Sippin' Wocky in October, look like apple cider (Ah)
I got a pistol with a glitch, this bitch shoot rapid fire (Brr)
I wouldn't run, the scope on it came with a magnifier (Brr)
Scrape up the extras, I'm a maximizer
The skid mapped out in my head, shit, I'm a strategizer (Yeah)
How I make it to Kentucky when the tags expired?
I fucked around and burnt my fingers rollin' out a bag of fire (Ha, ha)
Paid a hunnid fifty for some turbo, this a Taycan (Porsche)
If you seen us shake hands, we probably made bands
I'm ten toes in my Ian Connor's, boy, these ain't Vans (Nah)
What I'm droppin' in my pop, it look like grape jam
Shit, I just bought a thousand (Shh)
I can't even tell you what, I just thought about it (Brrt)
I lock my lips then lose the key, can't even talk about it
(Brrt)
I don't think that's real Virgil, something off about it
(Ha, brrt)
Kansas City chief, I'm dropping red into my Baja Gold
Yo' lifestyle amateur like, shit, you not a pro
On stage with the baby Drac', ready to rock and roll (Brrt)
So much drip up in my closet, walk in like, "Geronimo"
Turn his Lamb' into a stretch, limousine style
I'm mixing RPs with my lean, feeling mean now
Why you playin'? Got the reaper up on speed dial
Smoking za, it's like a comic strip when I breathe out
Get the rebound (Yeah), throw it down court
If you really 'bout it, what you stayin' in the house for?
2023, my goal, stress less and count more
Why the fuck you worried 'bout my bag? I hope you found yours
