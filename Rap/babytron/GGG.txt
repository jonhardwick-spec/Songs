[Intro: BabyTron]
I had the chance
(Whew)
To make love to you again
(Hey, bitch,
me and Brando, we are on it
)
I'd hold you in my arms
(Hey, hey)
And I'd never let it end
(Bitch)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Sneaks European but the Drac' Russian
Twenty deep with the gang, got the stage jumping
Money talk nowadays, I don't say nothing
Like I'm playing shortstop, I know that it's a play coming
129 BPM, that's for SB
It's a dirty game like fuck what the ref see
Talking 'bout the deep? You ain't even got no wet feet
Woke up and made a ten, you was in the bed sleep
Hit the club, make it hail, snow, and sleet
Ten toes, two feet, boy, it ain't no ho in me
Bluе hundreds, red sneaks, and I'm in hеre pouring pink
DSM at the top, shit, that's how it's 'posed to be
Been working, whip skrrting, pulling up, they get nervous
Akhi caught a body in it, had to go and switch turbans
This the Glockiana walk, would've thought my hip hurting
You ain't even make a thousand, was that lil' trip worth it?
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Why the fuck they still sleep like they took a Xanny?
Left my kids on her couch like the bitch a nanny
Where the real bitches at? I don't know any
I could never be fake, it is not in me
I be all in her guts when she don't answer
If you really want smoke with us, you must want cancer
I'm doing two-twenty, still tryna go faster
They gon' talk no matter what you do so it don't matter
If I had a chance to beat it up, boy, I probably would
No cap, me and Tron used to really jugg
Metal on me like a knight, you can call me "Suge"
Keep in stock a choppy, pulled up on 'em like, "What's good?"
You ain't good at rapping but your people scared to tell you that
Riding 'round in the two-seater with the ceiling back
You ain't gotta tell me 'bout no money 'cause I'm where it's at
Bitch booty got some recoil 'cause it's really fat
