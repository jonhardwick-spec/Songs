[Verse 1: JID]
(Hey, JID, bro, what good?)
My nigga, what's happenin'? I'm back in this ho
(Hey, what goin' on with y'all folks? I hope y'all straight)
Fuck all them crackers, I'm packin' a pole
(Ayy, fuck all 'em stupid-ass racist bitches)
I gave them rappers they time at the podiumI ain't spoken, I ain't speak in a momentIt's been a minute, I was feedin' the homeboy
(Where the hell you been then, little bruh?)
Holdin' it down, keep my niggas afloat
(Oh, you mean like investin'? Like givin' back to the community?)
He in the mound with pounds of dope
(Oh shit, I see what you mean, boy, you hell)
She got the mouth and the throat of a G.O.A.T. (Woah)
But be on the prowl to go fuck on my bro (Woah, shit)
You scandalous hoеs, Olivia Pope (Woah, shit, woah, shit)
I'm having some motion (Woah, shit)
I'm having some brunch in Miami with Hova
I'm braggin', I'm boastin'
I'm Black as fuck and just bе draggin' my scrotum (Woah, woah)
I'm mad as fuck at how they had or have us in ropes (Woah, shit)
Half don't have a daddy at home,
half doin' dope
Habitat a hazard, they having stones
Niggas hassling, running homes
Like a habit, but amateurs, anywhom
(Run through that motherfuckin' shit on the daily)
Look at me, drippy, he fresh off the boat
(Boy, where you goin', where you been, where you goin' to?)
Can't fit the crown on the head of a G.O.A.T
(Exactly, nigga, roll that shit up then)
Uh, look, half of an ounce in the pouch of my coat
I used to be surfing on couches and sofasNeeded a shower with water and soap
(Damn, lil' dirty ass nigga, how'd you get this shit then?)
I put this shit on my back for the team
(Oh, you better protect yourself, nigga, I know you ain't playin')
My chopper sing, Dion, Celine
(That my motherfuckin' dog, he ain't playin' with y'all fuck niggas)
One for my mama and one for my queen
Not one for the drama or causing a scene (Woah)
They caught him in traffic out on 20-East (Woah)I come from Atlanta, I'm Tony, I'm Tony Montana
I told 'em, I toe 'em, I tag 'em
My brodie told me put my dope into rap
While he wrappin' dope, he put his hope in the trap
In a total package, I don't know if he braggin'
But niggas knowin' who be holdin' it
Havin' in the hood, constantly battlin' bad or good
I ain't mad at him, all of us gettin' jugged
Now I don't give a fuck
(Now you know your ass give a fuck, boy)
Well, I gotta wrap this up
Gotta go to the cash, never had too much
Got a bag in a flash, then I passed you up
The raps is a wrap, I could smack you up
Like a pimp cup in a cap with a limp, whippin' a 'Lac on rims
I thought it was him (I thought that was you, my nigga)
JID catch a nigga workin' out in the gym, uh (Oh, shit)
