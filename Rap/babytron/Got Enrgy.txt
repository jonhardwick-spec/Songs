[Intro]
(
I got so much energy
)
[Verse 1: QpOnABeat]
Slime a nigga out like Lil Keed if I know he got it
Used to rock Vans, now it's Off-White and Balenciaga
Heard that nigga plottin', kill his plans with the pocket rocket
Tie a nigga up then beat him cold like my name was Rocky
Cut his hands off then put his heart up on the black market
Tie the plug up then take his funds and buy a Aston Martin
Told bro that ain't no pressure, put that weed down
Glocks suppresed, sound like I'm tryna hold a sneeze down
Bitch, pull your pants back up and put your knees down
Niggas used to hide they hand when they seen me around
Rats tryna infiltrate the trap 'cause it's cheese 'round
White girl playin' in the snow, it ain't no skis 'round
Bitch ate the whole gang up like Ms. Pac-Man
Nigga only got weed in his trap, how you the pack man?
Chillin' in the trap with my shooter, that's my wack man
Black as hell, walk down with a strap, I think I'm gat man
Took my white boy out robbin', think I'm Batman
Got slimed with a green mask, shooter slatt man
White girl playin' with them racks 'cause a OnlyFans
Boy, that ain't your dog shit, that's your homie bands
