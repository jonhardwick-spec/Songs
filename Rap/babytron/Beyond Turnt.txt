Getta Beats
)
Bitch, yeah
What up, Getta?
Damn, fuck, shit, yeah
[Verse 1]
We be rolling out like some Autobots, I mean Decepticons
BabyTron, she throw the pussy at me then I'm Megatron
201s green, I got a vendor, he from Lebanon
Road running, fill the foreign up down at the Chevron
Five thousand dollar fit, I give the bitch expensive vibes
High as hell getting shoes, I had to guess my size
Mike Jordan tendencies, bitch, I'm the best alive
Winter 2021, it's apply some pressure time
201, one-on-one, I'm at the self-scan tweaking (Yeah, huh, huh)
201, one-on-one, I'm at the self-scan tweaking
I ain't gotta throw a jab, I'll have my mans beat him
Why you taking pics by that Chally? That's yo mans' Demon
If I blow a whistle, guarantee that Stan leave 'em
Zip of Runtz in these Ksubi jeans, it got my pants reeking
MacBook, writers, and some (Fyoo), it's a scam meeting
Two hunnid dollar joggy, fifty in it, this what scammers do
I'll let the hammer loose, fuck around and handle you
You be caking with the bitch, I'm finna get my candle blew
Jeff cashed the buffs and then I did, that's a scammer view
Pouring potion in the Lab, it's getting hazardous
Active road runner, on my way to go and
jam some chips
Bible in the trunk, hope God with me if I crash the whip
I'm a scammer, unky in the trap with some slabs and bricks
Wide open, game winner, promise I won't pass this bitch
Asian off the Cookie
, Jeremy Lin in a standard clip
I could up some dog shit, I ain't just acting rich
Seen you up at Somerset, why you wasn't dragging shit?
