[Intro]
(
Ayo, Mark A
)
Slide down his block, we gon' pimp your ride
Phew
ShittyBoyz
Uh-uh-uh
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Chorus]
Slide down his block, we gon' pimp your ride
Don't reach for that, we ain't gang, you can't get no five
Eleven hour shift, doggy finna work a six-to-five
Ain't nobody open, isolation, bitch, it's dribble time
Exotic Cookie in my 'Wood, this a burner cough
Wave riding? Can't relate, I don't surf at all
Told the bitch, "If it ain't ShittyBoyz, then turn it off"
Never worked, I'm a boss, never did I perp' at all
[Verse]
Road running, popped a tire on the way here
Whole hundred in this chop, you better stay clear
High as hell on the East, wokе up on State Fare
If you see me in thе function, know I got some pape' there
Clase Azul and '42, my bitch is getting lit
Chuck Norris, unky in the spot kitchen, kicking bricks
Two mags taped together, flip around and switch the clip
Rap, but I'll come and pimp your ride on some Xzibit shit
.223s hit his trunk, put some boom in it
He riding in a bucket, he ain't got no zoom in it
Widebody, if I push the pedal, hear the vroom in it
Droptop coupe, buffs on, looking cool in it
Slide down his block, we Los Santos Customs
Cut it out with the fam, I don't really have no cousins
Rap star, I'ma chill and just have bro bust him
Put that lil' stack down, promise I can match your hundred
Big bank versus lil' bank gon' have you looking crazy
700 Yeezy Runners got me looking wavy
Oh, you want me at a show? Hit my booking agent
Three five of Turtle Pie, konnichiwa, I'm looking Asian
First class Delta, same day, thousand dollar flight
Cool kicks, I'm on Melrose for thousand dollar Mikes
Mike Amiri for my jeans, I'm the thousand dollar type
CVV so green, it's a thousand dollar site
Sleeping great, six figures by my nightstand
Yeah, I could've sold work, but I always liked scams
Bagging gifties with the left, jamming with my right hand
Walking out of Wally's with a smile, do my swipe dance
