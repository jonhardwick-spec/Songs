211 on the opps' block, murder, pain
We gon’ do the shortage every time we get to serve a lame
Baldheads in the clip, I came G.I. JaneHollows pull the dreads out his head, he look like Lil Wayne
Doggy askin' questions, think that he the CIA
German engineering, if I pop out, you gon' see i8s
It’s purple facial hairs on the 'za, but this babyfaceThe Runtz from Detroit, but they nicknamed MIA
Spot bangin' just like El George's
If I pulled out a scam trick, you would've fell for it
I'm in a 'Cat time-skippin', turnpikе teleportin’It look like somеthin’ died in this cup, you see the rigor mortis

I might take the hundreds out the stash and build a fortress
When it's beef on the floor, boy, that grill enormous
Molotov the opps’ block and make human torchesHit a bitch once and then park her like a pair of Forces
Dropped a line in my cup that cost a pair of Jordans
You the mascot, I'll bounce right over you like Aaron Gordon
Thick-faced Rollie on my wrist, but not Tracy MorganDog shit hangin' out my pocket like I a sold an organ
Cuddy snatched it off a tablet, then he sold a foreign
If you don't wanna get stripped, then that pole important
