[Intro]
(I got so much Enrgy)
Swear to God
Hey
[Verse]
Today's plans include flexin', I can't hold it off (Woo)
Wake up, roll a log, that's my protocol
When it rains, it's gon' pour, when it snow, it falls (Boom)
Y'all ain't got no game plan, get the coach involved
I'll buy a 'bow, then turn it into smoke and fog
Actin' like your recipe OG, that's some stolen sauce
Closet full of drip, it's looking like I went and stole the mall
Ridin' with the load, the mission is to drop it off
Shit, I'm flyin' up the road and I don't plan on hoppin' off
Score a pint and pour, pour, pour, catch me noddin' off
Actin' tough, you a ho, ho, ho, knock it off
Feel like Santa Claus, I might just come down through yo' chimney (Ha-ha-ha)
Boy, my shooter, he a hunter, he gon' do the Lindsey
Walked out, diamonds H2O, you'd think my jeweler rinsed me
In the O, Toledo to Dayton, we flew through Findlay
You got little green, Hornswoggle
, step and make the floor wobble
If we in the club, we buy the ones and give the whores bottles
Two-seater, four models, three-five, Perc 10
TRX done turned the street to gravel, watch me earth-bend
