[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
Real gangster, I ain't wearing no fanny pack
Louis V monogram jeans, where the blammy at?
Only way I'm sleeping with the bitch if she pay me that
Seven rings on like I'm Tom Brady, running back
She flew in to steal your money and you ordered that
Hatin' on me, but drive a Buick, you afforded that
In my early twenties, touching millions, had a Covid sack
Dropped a crazy eight Adidas check on some Maybachs
[Verse 2: Peso Peso]
Eight Moncler bubble coats, just dropped off a brick
Reach for the neck like it's sweet and get popped in your shit
Your bitch can go mountain climbin' with these rocks on my wrist
SRT Hellcat, I might just slide in thе pit
[Verse 3: Certified Trapper]
All them bricks that I twisted, man, my wrist need an AP
Twenty tee flawlеss, lil' nigga dropped an eight-piece
Hit a nigga's shit from a distance, cost an AGs
Get on nigga ass with the switch, sold me fake P's
