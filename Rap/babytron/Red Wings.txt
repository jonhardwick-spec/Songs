[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
Ha, yeah
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Back on Plymouth, had to tap in with ScrumbleMan
Running up in a Moncler? Get yo bubble blammed
If I don't like the price, up stick, fuck the running man
2017, made ten off of punch with Stan
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Very next year, made twenty off the slides with Tron
Toss a 7.62 at him, ain't the boxing kind
Baking for that dough? Bitch, we Papa John's
Up at Somerset, the only time you see me drop a dime
[Verse 3: TrDee]
It ain't many like me, she won't go away
When I'm not around or in the room, wonder what they say
It don't matter, they gon' hate no matter what you do
It's some cake laying on me now, I can't cake with you
All I want for Christmas is some recognition
Ain't no fighting, .223s for a exhibition
Ever since a youngin' all I want to do is run up digits
No, I'm not a killer but please don't push me to my limits
