[Intro: BabyTron]
ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Fit wet as hell, I drip water like Poseidon
Punching DoorDash, I got Ruth Chris arriving
Feeling too blessed, I'm AP in Verizon
Just touchdown, bitch, I'm feeling like a
[?]
Baby, check the rating stats, been maxed out
Dee a bulldozer, he just cleared Saks out
Ric Flair cookie, this'll make you tap out
Slam dunk like Stackhouse, I done blew her back out
[Verse 2: StanWill]
When I was down, I had a piece for every puzzle
The way I punch shit, you would think I like to tussle
You strong with the hands? Bro blowing off your muscle
Look me in my eyes, all you see is the hustle
Good approval so I signed ShittyBoyz
Upping checks on niggas, whole life I been unemployed
Had a heart once but now the juggs for the boys
Brodie punching up for some belts like he fuck with Floyd
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Baby K'll fling his ass to the ozone
Bro slid for the ice, call him "Frozone"
Pops said the belt ain't shit, life goes on
You decline in six stores, dude, go home
Brought some new jacks to the city, feel like Nino Brown
Ten bands in two days, this the shit I dreamed about
Running up a check, I'm getting sweaty, bitch, I need a towel
Jule'll put yo ass in a suit like you reading vows
