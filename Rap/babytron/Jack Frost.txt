[Verse 1: TrDee]
I can turn a cashier into Kash Doll
Use to be the little man to 'em, I can brag now
Tapped in like Wi-Fi, I don't lag out
Push to start just to get us warm and then I stab out
It ain't too many like me, I'm a rare breed
Did I mention when I heard your song it made my ear bleed?
Say the word then it coming like a stampede
Told your bitch to ignore your call so we can proceed
Went to sleep feeling like the shit, I woke up at two
Man, I seen that roll before, that is not new
Glock-10 and bald headed, hit 'em with a Caillou
Sick of this fake shit around, you a achoo
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Huh
Rock and ride with this Drac', I'll pop you
BabyTron, I could shoot the bag or I could lob 'oops
Sniper finna come headshot if he spot you
Pikachu, put the beam on you then I shock you
Finna drop a chain off the phones, bitch, I'm Jack Frost
No PornHub, I'm in Sprint getting jacks off
Feel like Trae Young, shooting threes out the Trackhawk
He tried to lock the door, pulled up and shot his latch off
You buffed up but in the same fit, you a action figure
Probably some expensive-ass brand if I tag my picture
201, this a magic trick, I'm a scamming wizard
On 9 mile, tell the plug meet me at Dequindre
