[Intro: BabyTron]
(Brrt)
313 Mafia
(Brrt)
You're not makin’ this easy, Kyle
(Ayy, shit easy, like)
(That's how this shit is, dude)
(ShittyBoyz, Dog $hit Militia, you know what the fuck goin' on, yeah)
[Chorus: BabyTron]
It was three digits in the clip until his mans ran off (Huh)Dumb decision, gave him half, Zach Randolph
(Brrt)
Jacks, checks, slides, bet the scam fam’ ball
Hit it doin' deals, I just bought yo' mans half-off
To get you killed, it ain't a method, I'll cash all
Bitch done made her first ten thousand dollars, think she Kash Doll
Treat the GLE like a lotto' ticket and scratch off
Doin' all that barkin', but you pussy, CatDog
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
We on a run for the ages, this the victory lap
I knew I had the future in my bag back in history class (Man)
Gang slidin’ in some shit, look like the Mystery Van
I did it masked up, crime in the D, bitch, I’m the mystery man (Shh)
Phone slammin' like a piledriver (Brr)
Never set a trend, you just a style biter
Fuck around and flood my teeth with VVs so I smile brighter
Sendin’ cuddy to the sto' for, hit, he an isle-niner (Damn)I'll tell a bitch to kick dirt (Fuck on)
Whole time, you eatin' hoes like you Big Lurch
Fanta from Japan with the Wocky, this a rich burp
Call of Duty Zombies, bro just popped his fifth Perc’ (Ah)
I ain't askin' nobody for nothin', that's just how I think
Toronto Raptors, not no Super Sonics, that's just how I drink
(Nah)
We can't hang, grabbin' Cubans, that's how I link
I was underground, now I'm higher than the mountains reach
Hundred overall, shit, my craft mastered
You ain't gon' get anywhere in life if you a half-asser (Swear)
If you catch me in the club, I got a lamb platter
Dog $hit Militia, out in traffic, we some cat scratchers
