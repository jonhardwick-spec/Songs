Lyrics from Snippet
[Intro]
...
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up (Uh-uh, ayy, ayy)
[Verse]
It ain't
Toy Story
, but I know the Chicken Man
I'll pull a quarter-ticket out and hit the Chicken Dance
I'll give your ass a whole band 'fore I give a damn
Mutant switchy, boy, you better pray the trigger jam
Up the RP, I ain't a minuteman (Ayy)
Lil' brodie only thirteen hittin' scams (Sheesh)
Yes, I heard a opp finna kick the can (Whew)
Old dawg, you would get your ass killed on cam' (Baow)
Let a 50 fly in [?], talkin' ceiling fan
You was a ham back then, and you still a ham
Used to post skits in all-black, and I'm still a vamp' (Still a vamp')
All this smoke in the air, you can blame Pirelli (Whew)
All the fiends they drop, you can blame the fetti (Ha)
This a fuckin' Rivian, boy, this ain't a Chevy
When you up button, gotta know it's hard to aim it stеady (Bah)
Huh, boy, this chain so heavy (Ayy)
Fifty-somethin'-thou' just for a plain old Presi'
You can hеar me three times, way when the [?]
Unc' stuck in his same old ways, and the 'K go steppin' (Uh)
I ain't even trippin' 'bout it, it ain't no pressure (Man)
Huh, lil' bro said, "This Draco' weather"
Sip and hit drank, you a outstandin' Kroll member
Why he stuck in the house? Dawg, he ain't no tether
What the fuck your mind on? 'Cause it ain't no cheddar (Man)
What the fuck your whip is? 'Cause it ain't no Spector (Man)
Why you worried 'bout me? Boy, you ain't no better (Man)
Cous' right behind the play, but he ain't no catcher
You can have four feet, still ain't no stepper
Boy, you a Jeffrey, you ain't no bender (Bah)
Sprite cool, T-B-H, I like Faygo better
That's only 10K a doze', boy...
