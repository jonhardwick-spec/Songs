[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Woke up in that Rolls-Royce, yeah, that Wraithy thang
One bullet, that's a head shot, bro got crazy aim
This a Hellcat, that's a Scat, we don't race the same
This a thigh pad, can't relate, you living day to day
It takes pape' just to make some pape'
Elevation takes separation, we creating space
Loose Cannon out of Chrome Heart, had to play the BAPE
Taliban ties, head wrapped and we came with K's
Used to drive a bucket, now I'm riding foreign
Chop hold a Wilt, new gen' Glock, Michael Jordan
Everything y'all do little, boy, our life enormous
Old school ShittyBoyz vibes, we ain't write a chorus
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Up before the rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo
You ain't got no money in yo pocket? She won't fuck with you
Don't say it's on the floor 'cause now it's up with you
You don't get respect in yo hood like a substitute
Foreign lil' bitch, give her dick, make her teach me Spanish
I can tell he not from the way by how he acting friendly
Heard yo mans keep getting locked up, he a shitty bandit
Baby, I do not have a heart, I am not romantic
Real niggas in my circle, ain't no squares here
I'll put my dawgs on yo ass, they can smell fear
Neph' a bad boy like he Laimbeer
Bitch like, "They can't fuck with you", I'm like, "Damn near"
Caught him in the whip, that was his last ride
I don't give a fuck she got a nigga, I'ma still slide
Bitch caught me in the act and I still lied
No cap, unc' spot jumping like the old Clyde
