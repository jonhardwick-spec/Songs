[Intro]
(DamJonBoi)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Crunch time, it's finna get intense
He got one chance to show he clutch or he gon' sit the bench
When we poppin' out your bushes, ain't no time to hit the fence
[Verse 2: Certified Trapper]
My cup purple, bitch, your cup green
Got a burst on the chop, I don't need no beam
I be on the Mile, I be on the East
Head-tap his ass 'cause he looked at me
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
If you want us in your city, send that booking fee
My bitch lookin' heat, boy, you lookin' cheap
We'll get 'em cooked with grease, get a pussy put to sleep
Out of town, in the trenches, lookin' for somethin' good to eat
Trapper got a book with him, all I know is push the P
My dread head spinnin' 'round like he Booker T
You might as well have shot blanks, you ain't hit a thing
I love how the Wock' taste, you can see it in my face
Off a 'shroom or two, I see the colors getting vivid
I'ma call him froggy, sippin' green, I think he finna ribbit
Load too big to take the stuffer route, I can't even fit it in her
Put her in my palm and then I play her like a fidget spinner
