[Verse 1: Mike Sherm]
Ay
Money on the floor, what’s the lo?
Let a nigga know
Nigga take my hoe n I’m like “So? I’m letting bitches go”
Colder than the snow
Three triple 0 up on the fucking coat
A nigga made a post n said I’m broke, I take that as a joke
I do this shit with no promo
Still shit on niggas no homo
G’s on me no polo
My shit jumpin’ like a pogo
I’m powered up like Goku
Super Sayian, Fuck you sayin’
Fit cost a couple bands
Bitch I’m that fucking man
I got good dick, for a, bad bitch
I was, dumb broke, now I’m, mad rich
All my, new hoes wetter than my last bitch
And I be talkin’ shit, Ion need no adlibs
My shit is not average
Fucking with ratchets
Not fucking with crashes
Got tint on my glasses
I really got action
Put that shit in the caption
Been in the game, I don’t gotta practice
N***** tryna hate, I’m just being grеat
Hella chicken on my plate
I ain’t finna takе no break
Every week a different state
Crib got a gate
Bitch wanna date
Bitch better wait
Hold on
