[Verse 1: MJPAID]
Then my kicks cost me nine hundred
Clearin' five, that shit only took me five punches (
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
Let the bitch hit the burner, damn near died from it
ARP, it got the flash, you can't hide from it
[Verse 2: Fordio]
And if it ain't about no pape', why we havin' discussions?
She said I'm probably out here fuckin', quit with the assumptions
Know I ain't rushin' with this shit, I know my time comin'
And I know I'ma get it as long as my mind on it
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Shit, droppin' O red in the newest Crush
Pape' flyin' like we seen a Loomis truck and blew it up
DSM, we bully made, we catch an opp and chew him up
Control my dreams off the drank, I'm sippin' out a lucid cup
[Verse 4: MJPAID]
Evеn in the summer, bitch, I'm booted up
Soon as I got thе coor', bitch, I suited up
Droppin' fours with the fives, man, I'm through with cups
You was at the top, now you not, you done blew the buzz
This shit here ain't new to us
Niggas on the scam sayin' what they gon' do to us
Damn near had to open lane and I threw it up
Niggas lowkey hatin' on me, still be showin' love
