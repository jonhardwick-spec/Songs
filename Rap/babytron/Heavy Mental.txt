[Intro]
Long live $cam, this is for you, brother
Hmm (
Meech
)
[Verse]
If I lose it, she gon' leave me, if I leave her, she gon' lose it (Sss, phew)
If I lose it, she gon' leave me, if I leave her, she gon' lose it (Ah, ah, ah, tss, tss)
I, I got em' sick, they let me beat 'em to it
Think they forgot who they got it from, it's time to re-influence
Why they, why they, why they, why they, why they think that we into it?
They better keep it movin'
Never stepped in front of camera, ain't no way to peep the shooter
Better re-think that backdoor, these twenty cameras peep intruders
I be heartless 'til that motherfucker drop, just seen the troopers
Rappin' like he supercharger, pulled up in a PT Cruiser
I know a robber got his cap peeled tryna take
I know some scammers got some jacks, built up like some crates
I know another robber, every skid, it goes successful
Know some motherfuckers wearing capes, they got some hoes to rescue
I know some villains too
He think he wild, really just a 'rilla in the zoo
My bitch like, "They ain't real as you"
Feelings bottled up, but really I ain't even tryna spill my juice
One of one matter of fact, one of none, but take my pills by twos
You asking who got killed by who like we won't kill you too
Yeah, I seen that one shit, it's okay, we gon' come kill you soon
I ain't looking for no cool points, I'm cool, boy
We'll leave him floating in the water like a pool toy
Down to your last, I don't feel bad, that was a you choice
You the type score two points
You a role-player, my ho a soul taker
You got low motion, you got no paper
Here come more fans, here come more haters
Do I look like Derrick? I ain't ask for noâ€”
I ain't ask for no favors
Moncler bubble coat, this ain't no flavors
Beatin' up that interstate, guess that I'm a road rager
Ain't no tellin', I might leave out right now, I might go later
Your run been ended, time to grab the coat hanger
2024, it's more properties and more acres
A lot of shit I did, ain't never get no thanks
They out here telling fibs, thinking it's gon' get 'em rank
But really, it's gon' get 'em spanked
Lately, I done had a heavy mental, someone get the drank
Everyday the clock buzzin', I be tryna win the game
Really, I be looking at this life shit the same
By the time it end, I gotta catch the dub
Overdid the zotti, like, does someone have an extra lung?
Shh, you can barely hear the Tesla run
Never been called the GOAT, you ain't the best at nothin'
You ain't even at your best, but acting like a critic
By the time I'm done, it's gon' be best that ever did it
