Part I
[Intro]
This is something special for you
[Verse]
I do some wrong shit right so I don't get caught (Woo)
You do the wrong shit twice, you gon’ get chalked
Call the Glock NASA, if it hit you, you gon' lift off
The foot work Human Race, watch me drift off (Drift off)
Deep down inside, all that hating shit is really love (Woo)
Deep down inside, I think they hate 'cause I really jugg (Woo)
Deep down inside, I think they hate ’cause I'm really plugged (Woo)
But for real though, I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm really up (I'm really up)
Walking up on tip, better step back like Dončić
If she check the drip, guarantee that bitch on dick (Ayy, ayy, drip)
Lionel Messi with the Glock, that bitch got kick (Brr, ah)
Dwayne Johnson with chopstick, bro gon' rock shit (Get over here)
I don't wanna die, but if I die, I’ma die a legend
Play with my cheese, boy, that’s a quick ride to heaven
Jugg Messiah, bitch, you'd rather do a nine to seven (Woo)
Fuck being a hundred, I was born ten times eleven (I was born ten times eleven)
I came in an underdog, I’m leaving MVP (I am)
Had a heart once but this bitch emptied me (She did)
Rather get a bag then a bucket, it ain't meant to be
Keep your head up, boy, you might catch up eventually
You got your first BAPE? Come on now, that shit probably fake (Woo)
You think that he solid, huh? But your mans probably fake
Wouldn't bust a grape, if you see me, you would probably faint
Scored forty dolo in the wide, feel like Emoni Bates (Feel like Emoni Bates)
