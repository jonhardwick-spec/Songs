[Verse 1: DaBoii]
I'm in love with the streets but it ain't no love
Bouncing out the whip with Baby A, nigga, don’t run
Bitch, yo brother died, what you gon’ do? Go and post sum?
I'll pull up to the opps hood, go and post up
Doing what you can’t and I'm doing what I'm 'posed to
High off the drank, me and bro pouring fours up
And I heard you had that bitch on you when you froze up
She like, "D Boii, you don’t really love me", I'm like no duh
Yeah, I would've hit yo lil' blunt but I seen no bud
Told baby if she down to ride, I'm the chauffer
Nigga said that he was up a mill', none to show for it
Bitch keep calling back to back, baby, hold up
Bitch, grab that pursе and them heels, go and ho up
If I hit the sis and the cuz, I givе no fucks
Yeah, another opp on the news, nigga, toast up
