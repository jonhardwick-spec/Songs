[Verse 1: StanWill]
You could be Lionel Messi, I wouldn't kick it with you
Two slips for a meal‚ we eat off different menus
I can't feel love‚ baby‚ I don't see a difference in you
I'm just tryna get up in yo walls like I'm living with you
Got more straps than a Nuketown Free-for-All
Swipers life, told coach, "You could keep the ball"
Played it smooth‚ cashier couldn't peep the fraud
Eye on my Kenzo tee, I done seen it all
Dr. Miami over here, don't get yo ass shot
Butterfingers over there‚ you let the bag drop
Piece too fire, nah, this ain't the last stop
I'm the type to run that shit up until my calf pop
Real superstitious but I'm still finna come Wraith
Crazy how this U of M bitch got the dumb face
In my bag, hell nah, I can't pump brakes
Bro a real shooter, hell nah, he don't pump fake
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Ha-ha, yeah, we on two different levels
Flying past y'all, we pushing on two different pedals
I'm on the road and you at work, that's two different schedules
There's y'all boys and then it's us, it's two different levels
Ha-ha, two different levels
It's y'all boys and then it's us, it's two different levels
Flying past y'all, we pushing on two different pedals
I'm on the road and you at work, that's two different schedules
