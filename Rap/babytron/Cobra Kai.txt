[Intro]
Huh, yeah
Slide down and strike first like I'm— bitch
Slide down and strike first like I'm— yeah
(
Stupid Dog, I ain't gon' lie, this bitch hard
)
Bitch
[Verse]
Slide down and strike first like I'm Cobra Kai
Dirty pop and a zip of Runtz, boy, you know I'm high
Cuz throwing fours, know some Bloods out here throwing fives
Sometimes to win, you gotta gamble, pussy, roll the dice
Bitch, I'm at the nino with the high-rollers
Tripping over hoes? No, I'm balanced like a tightroper
Touch a pendant, boy, your life over
Dog Shit Militia, slide down, take out five soldiers
Ain't a snake, but I'm cold-blooded
Twelve hours straight, you ain't really out here road running
Overnight, through the air, bitch, the 'bows coming
Cut up into dog like, "Why you looking like you stole something?"
What's in your pockets? Better empty 'em
I ain't like the Gucci flops, I had to Fendi 'em
Rollie time, brodie told Hutch to come and Presi' him (That's that big face, bitch, lil' stupid boy)
Doggy ran off, I can't say what I'ma do to boy
Gotta play Wes, gotta fuck around and shoot to joy
Cartier buffalos on like I'm
Juice Leroy
Shooter on a killstreak, might see a damn nuke deploy
Fuck the haters, boy, I know it hurt they soul to see me win
I can do a verse, sixteen, that's an easy ten
I can tell them buffs kudos with them cheesy lens
Got on Vlone, but please don't think we friends
Doggy dropped a bag, got some greasy hands
Sneakerhead, ain't you see the trunk full of Yeezy, man?
Jugg tour, head came to me, that's an easy ham
3 AM, made a light dub, did my sleepy dance
I was off a three of Wockiki
Chops with me, finna drop the tint, pray the opps see me
Own ten in Greenfield, finna go and drop Fiji
Can't go out bad in the verses, I am not Jeezy
Brodie on the roof, he just popped pill two
Finna go and blow the Presi' out, Tron Wilkes Booth
Brodie hitting shots from the corner, he got skill too
Dog was with his main mans, he got killed too
Sad story, can't be us, bitch, we keep 'em round
New jack city, all these phones, feel like Nino Brown
You ain't got no plays, I got three lines beeping now
Talking 'bout a foreign, but your car don't even growl (Yeah)
Late night riding, late night thinking
Fuck champagne, celebrating, we be pint drinking
In the sunlight or when it's dark, see the ice gleaming
OT, cops flick me, told 'em I was sightseeing
Unky in the mountains, no street lights, he high beaming
Japanese steak, told 'em make sure that the rice seasoned
Or I'ma smack the shit out the chef
Dog shit, dog shit, they pissed that I left a mess
