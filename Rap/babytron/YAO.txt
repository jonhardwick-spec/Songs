[Intro]
(
Ooh, Stan, turn me up
)
Man, you should've been made me one of these, Stan
That old bag, that old us, ha-ha, ayy
Red bottoms on, that's a strawberry jelly step
Ha-ha, shit, ayy (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hey (Hold on)
Hey (Ayy, ShittyBoyz)
[Verse]
Red bottoms on, that's a strawberry jelly step
Weigh 130 but I'm still coming heavy press
Blowing big-ass 'Woods, I take heavy breaths
Tie my Adidas up then I go and step on necks
Swear I'm up dog shit, I'm the shit, dawg
Get the fuck out my face, bitch, I'm pissed off
Hit Saks, act bad then I drip sauce
Astronaut, if I hit him, he gon' lift off
White tee hit for a dub, it got a gator on it
Yellow Gatorade, the pint purple, I'm the Lakers on 'em
Orange Scat turned into a super racer on 'em
Dee turnt up off the Hen', ain't no chaser on him
Huh, bad bitch with the braces on her
Lil' light skin demon put the face up on me
Out of town bitch eating sushi 'cause she hate the Coney
Cooking up with that, throw an apron on me
We don't tolerate no snakes
Feel like Yao when I'm hopping out the bank
Footwork Euro, boy, I'm shopping without breaks
Hit J. Ale's, I can't shop without a steak
Bitch threw a fit, she can't shop without a face
Feel like RiRi, how I'm popping out with Drac'
Shooting shit to Lance and I can Rocket Watt the play
Draw that shit up, hit the road then operate, ayy
I can't get the time back that I wasted
If they give you time, Jack, you gon' face it
Big-ass Demon take a chunk out the pavement
Used to ball in my dirty shoes, Calvin Cambridge
Wave runners, I'll drown before I jump ship
Pop darker than the moon but it's a Sunkist
Chopstick Karate Kid, it got that one kick
Two bitches put they head down then they tongue kiss
Sick tripping, rental flooded with some Visa cards
Me and Stan touchdown, Ronde and Tiki Barb
Chopstick flatline him, he need CPR
Fuck a telescope, it's the mirror when I see a star
Like, amen, dawg, this shit was God's choice
ShittyBoyz, make her say it with the Tron voice
Made a play at Capers listening to JonBoi
I'm the Punch God and I'll put that shit on God, boy
Rocking out with that metal like we Led Zeppelin
I play with fraud but bro and them be bench pressing
Only ping green this bitch got is her text message
Pipe it down, lil' bro and them be dread stretching
Never gave a fuck, that's my problem
If he gang locked in, yeah, I got him
Played with our money, LOL, then we shot him
Computer fraud, it's fucked up how I robbed him
Think that bitch loyal? Had her wrapped around my finger
Wocky off exotic pop like I got a fever
Bitch could put shit on God, still gon' not believe her
Soccer pants Human Races when I rock Adidas
Buffs on, fuck around and did the blade dance
Hutch beat my neck up with rocks, he a caveman
If you ain't SB, LOL, we ain't mans
Spin around in my Vlone like I breakdance
