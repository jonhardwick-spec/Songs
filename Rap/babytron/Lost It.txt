[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy,
ShittyBoyz
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
On my own wave, in a lil' boat, for real
Lil Boat and Tron? Two GOATs, for real (On God)
Shooter might drop a nuke, he on overkill
On this VPN, invisible like the Boatmobile (Skrrt-skrrt)
Black Louis belt, take it off and sensei him (Bitch)
Grab the work and shake it up, feel like Zendaya
(Ayy, ayy)
Made a dub OT, boy, that's ten layers (Twenty ball)
Threw a hundred on the chop, I'ma Ben Franklin
Pouring lines of the red like a typo (Woo)
In the spaceship, UFO and nitro (Skrrt)
Dragging bags off the fire, Spyro
Scoring dolo, boy, I'm Ivo on the iso (Ivo)
Bitch dumb, I just pulled eighty phones out her (I did)
Shawn Michaels, told her suck it, I'm a showstopper
(Slapped that bitch)
Good thrax and it smell like Davy Jones' Locker
Turned him to a ghost with the Tommy, I want more power
Dead inside, I ain't got no heart left (I don't)
In deep so my hoodie got a shark head
Send a super missile at him if he Clark Kent
Just dropped a hundred checks listening to "Dark Web"
[Chorus: BabyTron &
Lil Yachty
]
I done looked Death in the eyes and lost him (Whew)
All that love in my heart? I lost it
Where I'm at now, it was worth all the losses
Been running from karma my whole life, I'm exhausted (I'm exhausted)
And I'm just glad that I lost her (I am)
The pain in the rain turned me to a monster (It did,
Tron
)
Put my feelings down and picked up an embosser
Flea-flicker, I'ma pass her after Yachty toss her (
Ayy,
yeah)
