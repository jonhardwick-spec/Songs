Hey
[Verse 1: BabyTron &
Peso Peso
]
I can put you on your ass, put you on your feet
Put a bitch on a leash, switch on the heat (
Huh
)
Nigga broke than a bitch, live on the streetJust made a fifty in a week, blew that shit with ease
I got Ricks on my feet, tricks up my sleeve
Tell a trick that it's plenty fish in the sea (
Huh
)
Caught what's her name, I can't have him hit for a PIced out, finna go pull up on Johnny DangIt ain't nothin' to spend a dub, man, that's pocket change
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I gotta smoke and I just smell it, boy, I shop for taste
If it ain't no sealed pints around, then I'ma shop for eighths
If the mall didn't close, shit, I'd shop for days
Mitten baby, hit the Carti store, and then I shop for frames
Mittеn baby, Hutch or Golden Sun when I shop for chains
Mitten baby, chop likе Lamar, you can't stop the rain
Fordi hooked on the Stillpane, he threw the Wock' away
Roll an eight, then drop an eight just to concentrate
What I'm sayin' is I need my geek kit to operate
Before he get his head tapped, make him unlock the safe
