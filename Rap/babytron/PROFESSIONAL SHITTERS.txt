[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse 1: Since99]
Seeing dead people on my feet, I step exclusive
Always hiding on the web, you stay reclusive
Said she wanna give neck, I can't refuse it
A lotta hoes act toxic, air pollutants
Professor 99, really you just a student
Put a presi' on my wrist like Calvin Coolidge
Feds need to free Tay, he just be coolin'
Super smash hoes in the bed, I King K. Rule them
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Like some kneecaps, niggas got me bent
Mr. Play My Role with a bitch, used to be a simp
Glock got twenty in it, but it came with Shawn Kemp
Hеater gotta stay on me, give a fuck about thе temp
Hold on, that's your bitch? Boy, I hope not
Woke up getting money, caught the package in my flip flops
We was getting money, you was busy making TikToks
Let me say the word, it ain't shit for them to spin blocks
[Verse 3: Since99]
Triple S stepping, fuck that, they can kick rocks
Chains on my neck stone cold and the Benz hot
​iPhone 11 rose gold with a hotspot
Think his ass harder than Durant 'cause he team hop
Goddamn, he switching sides
I'ma have a whole mugshot if he mention mines
Whole quarter pound of the 'za, you copped a dime
Really think he talking out his neck, no, he ain't fried
