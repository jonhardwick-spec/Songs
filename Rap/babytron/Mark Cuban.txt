[Part I]
[Intro]
(I gotta adlib the very end of it)
Hey, hey, ShittyBoyz (
Meal
), Dog Shit Militia, long live $cams
RIP Chris (
Hey, OLLY
), you know?
Hmm, you hear this shit?
[Verse]
Doin' magic in the booth, call me Tronny Potter
They don't like lil' bro, it's 'cause he probably shot 'em
I don't fuck with the Pai, but I might Wocky pop it
The last thing he saw in life was a balaclava
All these boogers in the bus like a snot rocket
Thousand-dollar meal, I came from a Hot Pocket
We'll turn that SUV to a crotch rocket
I don't ball hog with my team, call me Tron Stockton
Y'all boys on the lower level, we be top notchin'
Y'all boys on the middle shelf, we only shop toxic
Who Decides War, you can't get these from Hot Topic
Had to get the Goyard, this bankroll gon' pop wallets
Off the drank, fighting sleep with the lazy eye
ROTY, MJ back in '85
If he reach for a chain, he a crazy guy
If I'm off an RP, that's my crazy side
