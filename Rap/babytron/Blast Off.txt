[Intro: BabyTron]
ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Fendi drip, I'm euro stepping like I'm Dwyane Wade
I was down bad and made eight in the same day
Jay Ale’s twice a day and I ain't even gain weight
Can't crack a smile in the bank, that's my game face
I pray to God I make it up 'cause I done sinned a lot
Buffed up, but weigh a buck twenty, I ain't did a squat
Used to work on my step back and my jump shot
The day that I'm broke is the day that my lungs stop
I came up off stealing shit, feel like Gary Payton
Used
to sleep on the floor, ain't even have a blanket
Since he a demon, bro gon' send his ass to Satan
Punches so fire, hit the store like a Super Saiyan
Acting rich but getting handouts ain't acceptable
ShittyBoyz got the power, something like Incredibles
Said that we broke? Brodie smacked off an edible
I left the store, make sure my signature ain't legible
[Verse 2: StanWill]
ShittyBoy, bitch, I'm hated by the janitors
Time to clock in, man, I know you hate your manager
I'm thrusted up every day up on the calendar
If bro on the road then the stick riding passenger
On the Web, punching kicks like karate
My bitch hating niggas, think I fuck with a Nazi
Pro'd up, I stay with bread like salami
Bro bring that plank anywhere like he Jonny
Wrestle who? Bitch, I don't do judoSquaring up can get your soul blew straight to Pluto
Hoes gon' be hoes so I play her like I'm Cujo
You ain't hip it to the ShittyBoyz? Bet y'all boo know
I been plugged in longer than y'all television
Mr. Paint-a-Freak-Bitch-Face, I'm a cosmetician
T-H-R-U-S-T, we the definition
And we done seen more power than electricians
