Damn
Jumped off a plane, I can't believe I'm seein' Canada
Brodie sellin' white, but I'm not talkin' 'bout no Angela
I might slap that bitch, I see her pullin' out her camera
Fuck her on that bed or I might take her out and stand her up
I need the whole pie, why we talkin' portions?
Your girl looks like a guy, I keep hoes on me like a Mormon
Got the blick nearby, and I can't even hold you, it's enormous
I don't gotta bust you, I tell bro whack you, I'm the foreman
Told my bitch hasta la vista, ridin' with a hot LatinaAudemars on Ascension, pendants, they on AquafinaWhen we pull up knockin' on your door, it ain't a box of pizzaShit, I came from poppin' Visas, boy, I'm only poppin' divas
Damn, I could spend a chеck to get fly, I got Delta cash
2023, all year, I'm puttin' bеlt to ass
Fell in love with weed the first second I felt the gas
Rap don't work, I told granny I'll sell the stash
Cracker in the D, I'm runnin' shit, I feel like Hockenson
She post the location, she won't never get the drop again
Plug said he got 'em for the low, I told him lock it in
You would think she punched DeMar DeRozan 'cause she popped a ten
It's plays that I'm conductin', 'cause I don't like to duck themYour girl be talkin' out of turn, a ho could never interrupt meLet 12 flick the lights and I'ma flee the scene abruptlyI was coolin' at the start, and then I let this shit corrupt meDouble parked at the Coney, strap tucked 'cause I'm bonyThey call me Tyler, but I really keep that iron like TonyI'm servin' sauce and beans to fiends, I could fix you minestroneYou can hear me slidin' down, the whip got seven hundred ponies
I got the monkey on my back, might go bananas, Mojo Jojo
You would need a hundred comrades with you, I be solo doloWhen I touch in NYC, don't bring no bags, I go to SoHoUnless you got a fifty-ball, boy, it's a no on promoI can't tell him nothin', he the type to show the po-posI'll get a pint and kill half of it, pour an ocho41 with chocolate face, you'd think this ho a RoloYou was in the game, now you just talkin', Tony Romo
