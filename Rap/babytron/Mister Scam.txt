[Intro]
ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
Tag what I'm wearing on the 'Gram, on some cash shit
You better not click on this link, you can't cash this
Steak hibachi when I'm out, told the waiter add shrimp
Jeff a ball hog with the 'Wood, he won't pass it (Woo-hoo)
I put it on me I'll send dawg to Jesus Christ (Fah)
My shooter pulling up at dark so you can see the light
I'm getting it for free, I don't gotta see the price
Tough on the phone, but that's alright, we gon' see tonight
Tucked the Visas in the bed, I can't sleep alone
Can't trust a soul so when it's beef, I'm gon' creep alone
Bro'll shoot yo' crib up even if yo' people's home
Just touch downed in A2 feel like Peoples-Jones
One long stroke and this bitch fell in love
Super senses for the scams, I can smell a jugg
Ain't no proof, so how are you gon' tell the judge?
Used to be a crumb but I turned them L's into
dubs (All facts)
Let's be real, y'all boys learned a lot from Tron (Bitch)
Slow it down, boy, you only punched some Papa John's (Lame)
UFC work, got more punches than a octagon
Don't get out of line, I'll make this .40 sing like Chaka Khan (ShittyBoyz)
Rest in peace Steve Jobs, made a killing off you (Huh?)
You better think with yo head before we peel it off you
Clip hold tornado bullets, rip the ceiling off you
And if you got good credit, I'ma steal it off you
Last name "Scam", first name "Mister" (Woo)
I am not yo brother, bitch, you are not my sister (Dummy)
Good Drac'll give a dreadhead a Derek Fisher
(Bah)
Ruth Chris again, I got a fetish with expensive dinner (ShiityBoyz)
I made that bitch give me neck, then get the phones
Left her at the Sprint store, don't care how she getting home
Chain on my neck, it's tangled up with this minute phone
Eating great, bitch, so don't make me up a dinner roll (Don't make me)
Don't ask me how to ball, I am not a trainer (Bitch)
And don't ask me for a solid, you can't get a favor
Choking on the dick, bitch said I'm her favorite flavor
Bitch claimed the ShittyBoyz but she used to be a hater
She blew me like a candle, got her Gerald Green on
I'm the one with a thousand dollar pair of jeans on
Oh, you a fan? "GameBreaker" this bitch theme song
Wife who? Bitch, go ahead and get yo dream on
I feel like Klay when he hot how I shoot shit (Fah)
Paul Pierce when I rap, I'm the truth, bitch (Facts)
You look like Trae Young, how he pull up shooting shit
I'd rather post a scam, you the type to post a mood pic (Lame)
Pump faker, you gon' fuck around and draw a foul
Bro'll pull up lifting souls if you talking down
'Member all them days that I used to be in lost-and-found
But that's okay 'cause my drip looking awesome now
Bust the first round off the pussy, feel like Greg Oden
Running up a check for too long got my legs swollen
Always been solo, boy, my bike ain't have pegs on it
Take an L and get a dub, you the type to dread on it
We are not kin, cut it out with the acting (Please)
Good lil' Nike tech off some Air Maxes
So much ammo in the trunk, don't need a care package
Told the lil' bitch, "Suck my shit, just don't stare at it" (Huh?)
I ain't gon' lie, bitch, my trust been gone (Huh?)
You think that bitch loyal? Boy, them cuffs been gone (Hah)
Bitch talking 'bout, "How you fuck this long?" (What?)
My off button broke, bitch, my thrust been on
I ball a lot 'cause they used to say I couldn't (Bitch)
I do a lot of shit that my mama said I shouldn't (I'm sorry)
Put you down for jumping up so I really wouldn't
BabyTron, I'm next up either way you put it (All facts)
ShittyBoyz lieutenant, put it on my headstone
Told my bitch I just got it, finna head home
Bitch said I wouldn't be shit, but she dead wrong
Dee throwing E's 'cause he grew up in the red zone (Red zone)
ShittyBoyz, yo' bitch love them two words
You suck at this rap shit, I know the truth hurts (Bitch)
Couldn't give my all so I gave her two-thirds
Got a white bitch who make plays like she Sue Bird
