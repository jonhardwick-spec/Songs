Playing both sides was never cool, don't get picked off
Told my bitch that she won't get a ring, she like Chris Paul
[Verse 2: StanWill]
If it's smoke with us, we'll throw yo baby on a respirator
Fendi t-shirt with yo bitch, let the F's amaze her
Thirty clip with a red beam, bitch, I'm Stephenvader
Got this bitch attached to my balls, I can't separate her
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Pull up tryna tombstone shit, I'm the Undertaker
Dog Shit Militia, lil' bitch, we some plunger breakers
Riding 'round hotter than a skillet, I'm with trouble makers
Blue, pink, green, shit, I got every color paper

Slim thick, she ain't got no titties but she got a wagon
Slide down and slide through the scene like, "Damn, what happened?"
Tore Neiman Marc' the fuck down like, "Damn, we splashing"Feel like Dominic Toretto, bitch, the whole family active
Sipping Wockiana, pinkies up, with our fancy-assesTwenty-eight Mike Amiris, never could I baggy pants it
