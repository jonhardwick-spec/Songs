[Intro: StanWill]
(
Saucerich, fuck nigga
)
(
Stupid Dog, I ain't gon' lie, this bitch hard
)
Yeah, ayy (
313 Mafia
)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Woke up thinking like I'm finna catch a flight today
Bitch thinking we got chemistry, she my science bae
Anything I want, I'ma get, it's a swipe away
I just want the head, not yo coochie, I ain't YN Jay
Nah, really just want the noggin off her
Probably on the phone with a ham, why I'm talking awkward
Shoes big as fuck so that's probably why I'm walking awkward
Feel like Aang when I'm in my closet, I'm tossing water
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Would've thought I hit the jackpot, I'm just upping blues
Pick up order, eating Black Rock in the coupe
Real scam rapper, brought the laptop in the booth
Unc' got caught, put the crack rock in his shoe
Woke up confused, why the fuck is my Spritе purple?
Flew herе, not grew here, lil' bitch, my Pie turtle
Shooter should've came ACOG but he like thermal
Two straps, buffs pushed up, I feel like Urkle
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Niggas watching how I'm living like The Truman Show
Even though the bitch credit seven, she a stupid ho
Only wanted that, what the bitch come Cupid for?
BBC tee, just a hunnid, it's exclusive though
Turned around and looked and saw my whole team was really up
She gon' shift her head and drive the boat, she do not need a [?]
If you talk behind my—, fuck
If you talk behind my back, you bet not say what's up
