[Chorus: 310Babii]
Walked in, no chains, but a nigga still glowin' (Huh?)
No permission slip, so that mean I ain't goin' (Nah)
She walked in with jeans, but her ass still showin' (Huh?)
Touched seven figures, bank account still growin' (What?)
She don't speak English, so I put her in the foreign (In a foreign)
Anything less than two mill', I'm ignorin' (Yeah)
Cut a bitch quick, she get no chance if she annoyin' (Cut)
Puttin' hoes to work, yeah, I'm the one that do employin' (Work, work)
[Verse 1: 310Babii]
Puttin' hoes to work, yeah, I'm a CEO (Huh?)
I'ma expose her to a life she never seen beforе (Yeah)
All these niggas tryna prеss you, but it's me you want (It's me)
Told her a whip ain't shit, baby, which V you want? (That ain't shit)
Yeah, I'm card swipin', young star shinin' (Yeah)
Yeah, I gotta get that bag, I go hard behind it (Go hard)
She walk around with all that ass, I gotta get behind it (Uh)
I'm top rank, it's not hard for y'all to get reminded (Yeah)
High IQ, you niggas on a lower level (What?)
Just to set the record straight, I ain't never settled (Nah)
Let 'em dig they own graves, here, hold the shovel
So first place, walk around with gold medals (What? What?)
