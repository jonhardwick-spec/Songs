[Intro]
This bitch give me "Legendary" vibes
Fuck it, I'ma call this bitch "Free Rio"
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
Long live $cam
THHL
Free unky, free Rio
Prince of the Mitten, king of the galaxy
Emperor of the universe (
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
Hey, hey, hey
[Verse]
Your bitch in here on the bed tryna front flip
Six hundred for the 'za, that's only one zip
Back in school, was skippin' class and jammin' one dips
Back in school, you worked a store, was sellin' Sun Chips
Turned it to Hawaiian Punch, it was Sunkist
Cuddy said it's backdoor season 'less they front bricks
Feel like Lil Wayne pullin' in, can't make the truck fit
Mr. Blow-It-Quick, you only spent a month rich
You gon' think we threw a party 'til the gun click
You the type of scammer make no money, only punch drip
Probably live up underneath a bridge, you lil' bum bitch
Fah
Get your ass on the ground
Bitch, it's a thousand pills in you, get your ass on the 'Hound
How we catch him out of bounds and still get him fouled?
I'ma nickname that bitch belt 'cause she get around
Red pape', must be permanent, huh? I see you still a clown
Brodie hot as hell, got so much beef, you'd think he killed a cow
Post my location OT, but shit, I'm still in town
I'm just tryna see what's on the floor
My junkie in here tweakin', tryna see what's on the stove
I don't plan on stoppin' soon, don't you see I'm on the go?
Ain't no exitin' or enterin', you see we on the door
Ain't gon' see us no time soon, you see me on the road
On foenem
Hall-of-fame Dimer, I'll pass the bitch to bro 'nem
No hat, no fakin', that's that
Every time he out, he duck, we gon' call him Aflac
All this syrup got me layin' flatter than a flapjack
Shit, it's hide-a-body season, time to cop a hatchback
Tryna shake off flashbacks, bein' broke, I'm past that
Cuddy whippin' up the white, look like vanilla Snack Packs
Movin' then I'm groovin', I'm professor with the snatch back
It's OV and OT if we win the coin toss
Heard you out here bein' hoes, hundred cool points lost
Dog a fuckin' cheerleader, he just root boy on
Shit, it's all fun and games 'til we come do boy wrong
ARP do K.Os, it's the new Roy Jones
Turn the night to dark side, this the new Joy Rode
Huh, nah, I ain't surprised, man, I knew boy told
Crazy that I'm so schooled, I had a 2.4
You blew a two-point lead, unc' take two grams, slam 'em
Watch out flyer than a bird, I had to Toucan Sam 'em
See you blowin' up her phone, she in here two-hand whammin'
Backseat's for artillery, this the two-man Phantom
Beat him with the switchie, I ain't want the cops to hear me
2024, I think it's time to stop Amiri
If it ain't facts, keep it quiet, time to stop the theories
Life a movie, shit gettin' so crazy, I might drop a series
Tuh, and throw that bitch on Hulu
Baby bottle with Promethazine, it ain't no gaga googoos
Plug got a translater 'cause he talk likeâ€”
Me and Prince a lil' Haiti, take our pop and do some voodoo
I don't know you, I ain't knew you
What I'm sayin' is we never was cool at all
Only time you ever dripped, it was probably a pool involved
Only time you got up, it was probably some stools involved
