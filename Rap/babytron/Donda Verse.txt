[Verse]
Yeezy 500, bitch, I punched 'em, I ain't pay for these
Six Os of Wocky in the Faygo, I can't taste the cream
Virgil made the .223s, fuck around and paint his tee
Palm Angels joggy, full sprint, catch me chasing cheese
Out of town fooling, I'll make the Lamb' twirl
Jugg Messiah, I'm the prophet of the scam world
Buffed up, these some Cartiers, ain't do no damn curls
Playmaker, if the head weak, I'ma pass, girl
Used to think I'll touch my first fifty off a hundred giffies
Brodie off thе Mike Amiris, unky in the cut in Dickies
Triplе-double everywhere I go, that's just the Russell in me
Pop the trunk and turn the tables if you try and tussle with me
Stomach full of lobster, I'm a mobster living like I'm Tony
Always on my side, don't you ever think it might be on me
Cold bitch and her contact got the ice emoji
4 AM, off a eighth of Runtz, finna ride to Coney
Fast brake lifestyle, y'all can't stop this
First-class, you be fifty feet from the cockpit
Being broke? I'm thankful that's a problem that I got fixed
Talking 'bout yo' dawgs vicious? Promise y'all are not pits
