[Intro]
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
Bitch, yeah
(
Ayy, Melly, what the fuck is that?
)
[Chorus]
I see a risk? I take it
I take a sip, I’m dranking (Ha, I take it, whew)
Bitch, I’m flier than a Martian, it’s only right I play the spaceship
(Whew, whew, nyoom, nyoom)
[Verse 1]
Summertime I’m in the Nike mask ‘cause, bitch, I’m famous
(Ha)
Roll it up then pour it up, I’m selfish, shit, I’m facing
(Whew)
You can’t keep it a hunnid? Bye-bye ‘cause, shit, I’m Franklin
Million dollar dinner plate on the table, the shit I’m craving
Shit, these bullets hot, he cooked with Cajun
(Whew)
Off a quarter of the Fortune Cookie, in here looking Asian
You was open, let him in your head thinking you shouldn’t take it
That shot? You could’ve made it
(Man, you gotta take a risk sometimes)
[Chorus]
I see a risk and take it
I take a sip, I’m dranking
(I see a risk and take it
I  take a sip, I'm dranking)
Bitch, I’m flier than a Martian, it’s only right I play the spaceship
(Bitch, I’m flier than a Martian, it’s only right I play the spaceship)
