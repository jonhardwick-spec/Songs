(
Damn, Glo, you killed this one
)
Like that
[Verse 1: KrispyLife Kidd]
I'm out there in that water like a coast guard
The smoke I'm giving these niggas free, no charge
These niggas down like my phone, it ain't got no charge
Call you young boys tooty fruities, y'all is not hard
Hold on, I don't think I wanna say it like that (
313 Mafia
)
I don't wanna cuddle, just put my thing in her
She been a notorious ho, but I put my faith in her
You in a Scat, I'm in a 'Cat, yeah, we race different
I got fifty, you got ten, yeah, we paying different
I'll never tell, that's why my case pending
Shrimp and steak for me, you like Mickey D's, our taste different
I don't like having fives or ten, my roll got a limit
Only time you hate is when you see me with a lot of women
I'm tryna stay focused, I'm in a big baggie
Niggas better get right or get hit with Kathy
I'm really GOAT and these niggas' step daddy
Was with my son and seen an opp and roped off the pep rally
I'm sick these niggas got five and they braggin'
If I had five, I wouldn't even show my family
I wouldn't even— hold on
I don't wanna say it like that no more, look
I don't think these niggas know how I'm bomin'
Hire a hitman from Jerusalem, he'll whack you for a plate of hummus
My nigga bought a 'bow with a roll of fake hundreds
I ain't your average nigga, so I can't go clubbing
Old girl can't spend a night unless she fucking
I don't wanna go to no party, I'll pop your cousin
Lowkey, I don't need no cosign, I'm top five
Last time I tripped was with Mike on "Monetized"
