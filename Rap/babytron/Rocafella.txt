[Intro: Veeze]
Gang-gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Fuck you (Skee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee)
Yeah (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Veeze]
We gon' get this money, that's forever like Santana
I'ma stitch the gang on all the Forces, Roc-a-Fella (What?)
This ain't "Pimp My Ride", I'm changin' paint on all the Phantoms
Boy, get off my level, I'm a twenty milligrammer
You see me cuffin' on a bitch, I was out of character
Pineapple pop with the Wock', now it look like carrots
Me and all this money said our vows, now we married
Parts for thirty-three, that shit so white, call it Larry
Any nigga ever try my gang probably buried
Nigga, if you scared to blow your gun, then why you carry it?
Walked inside the store and spent four thousand what I'm wearin'
Put so many pills inside your town, look likе the mayor
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Pop black as hell, look like I ashеd my—
Pop black as hell, look like I—
Pop black as hell, look like I ashed my 'Wood in it
Talkin' scams, your jack ain't got a single jugg in it?
Code Canadian, I paid a thousand up in Somerset
7.62s'll fuck around and make a Hummer wrecked
Wintertime, first things first, I gotta punch a TEC
Touchdown and stiff armin' shit and I ain't fumble yet
Off the Runtz, I'm lookin' Chinese, joggy Y3
Yeezy V3s cost a stack, I'm a Hypebeast
Gotta play right off a Mac, finna drive East
Run up in his crib and leave his body on the side street
SBDSM, that's the Militia, we ain't fuckin' with you
Wanna ride around with one of us, you gotta tuck a pistol
These ain't Converse, they Rick Owens, boy, the Chucks official
Speed dial, one call, Habibi finna come and get you
I don't sell dog, I do fraud
Wide-body redeye, I'm finna zoom off
High as hell off a lot of yeah, I'm finna rude talk
Ain't a dollar up in doggy pocket, I think dude lost
