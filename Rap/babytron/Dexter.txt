Stan, what it do?
Ayy

[Verse 1: G.T.]
I'm in the lab right now like Dexter
You punching but you ain't hitting shit, you a wrestler
My plug baldheaded, got bricks, call him "Hector"
[?] dark like a Pepsi
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Funny how we in the SRT, I'm with G.T
Three deep but we popping out like we 3D
I'll get a vegan in the room, make her eat meat
Leg on the chop, bitch, I run around with three feet
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Telegram chat [?] gotta talk in code
This lil' bitch phone off, how the fuck she call me broke?
MW3, no quickscope but it's off the dome
I was sixth man, touch the court, turn my baller on
[Verse 4: G.T.]
Mask on my face like I'm walking in the store
But I'm sitting in thе room with a table full of blow
You can't run 'cause the strap got thе beam and the scope
You mad 'cause the EDD gone and you broke
