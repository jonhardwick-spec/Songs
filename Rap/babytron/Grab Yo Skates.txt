[Intro]
Mm, hm
Mm, hm
Mm, hm
Hey, hey, grab yo' skates
Lock 'em in (Meech)
[Verse 1]
Out of town makin' money, this a paycation
Sixty overall would be yo' 2K rating
When you see me, you think power, I ain't raise Kanan
Had to get it out the mud, now it's ape's bathing
Whip flying, turned the garage to a space stationTime to start a new kit, I'm finna Plain Jane it
Meech on the beat, I know you hear the bass bassin'
Oh, your bitch? I hit it first, I guess I'm Ray J'ing
Heard a hater hating, I just told him show his bank savings
It get hot up in the kitchen, but it ain't a cake baking
Penthouse in the A, this my safe haven
Deep down inside dawg a fan, he just fake hating
Already said we gettin' paid, ain't no vacations
When we headed to the tension, no it ain't no baecations
Huh, ain't that what Face said?
I can't stop, how ironic that the drank red
I'll have my super gremlin pull up off a fake ten
Your baby locked in, like I'm in a playpen
Walk in the stu' just to preach, Amen
SBDSM invented fire, we some cavemen
Nah the haters they don't bother me, I hate them
You tryna make friends, we tryna make M's
Why you playin' with that lil' pape', you better save rent
At half-court, all my haters on the same bench
Out in Mexico, I got my 'migo on the stove
It's some shells on the counter, couple kilos on the floor
Only time you see me duckin', when I'm reloading the pole
I'ma keep blowin' these M's and I'ma keep blowin' these O's
Multi-personalities, you know I'm off the shrooms
I done lost all gravity, could catch me on the moon
Multi-personalities, you know I'm off the shrooms
I done lost all gravity, could catch me on the moon
Me and brodie in The Boondocks
Huey and Riley, you know I get up big ghetto, means Gucci with Nike
MAC-10 with silencer, I'm usin' the Uzi politely
Three-five of psilocybin, I let the boomies enlighten me
I'm damn near off a script, it's a movie inside me
Said she wanna earn a spot, like shit you got Louis to buy me
He done got his screws loose, and he ain't know tooly was by me
All this bomb, got to throw on all this damn jewelry to ice me
You ain't gotta "Teach Me How to Drill" I ain't Mabu
Tied in with cous' and them, and plus I'm cool with Pirus
Bitch want a blessing, she could "Achoo" on Salu
Halloweens I only rock the mask if the costumes
All these damn questions, you'll be actin' like the cops do
Cuddy robbed a opp for that clock, that's why his watch loose
Eyes all around my head, shit, I gotta watch you
