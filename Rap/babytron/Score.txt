[Intro: $camaurion]
Mmm, mmm, 72, ayy
(
Bang that shit
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
When you see me hangin' out that sunroof, I'm tryna send you to the moon
From the womb to the tomb
Since baby food was in my spoon I was tryna get it
Thirty shots in three-point-five, I think this lil' bitch kind of glitchin'
Before I knew my ABCs, was out here tryna get it
In the kitchen sweatin' with someâ€”, you'd think I'm fryin' chicken
Lyin' 'bout he in a spaceship, his rap science fiction
Bad habits with my double cup, I might just die addicted
I can see through the bullshit just like a Skelly
He don't want no smoke in here, gon' treat it like a telly
You want a job? Get a rental, have that license ready
Christian Loubies, sole on 'em lookin' like spaghetti
Multi-colored diamonds on my chain lookin' like confetti
Hotbox the Cullinan, I treat this bitch like a Chevy
You want some beef? Pull up then, we just like the deli
What I'm ridin' with, it give me life just like some fetty
[Verse 2: $camaurion]
You ain't never seen my site, the debit hit like credit
Off-White X on my back, bitch, I ain't an X-Man
Take the hit the road test, I know your ass gon' fail it
I could slide like the [?] fuck with the mailman
I ain't into takin' trips right now, my baby on tour
It ain't shit to catch a flight, got SB dunks on
I ain't fuckin' with the mics
Right now, I'm back in the stores, ain't fuckin' with the mic
Bitch, it's [?] 72, I'm grabbin' terabytes
Dee'll check a nigga temp', now he fahrenheit
Boy, I'm fuckin' on your hoes, but ain't no sharin' mine
I'm just tryna get more phones, I'm out here clearin' lines
I'll clear the whole sixteen lines out a pint
All I really like is Wock', boy, you out here sippin' Pie
