[Chorus: Siick P]
Man I sware this shit so real
Cause it is not cap
These niggas think I'm pussy cause I'm small
But it is not that
[?] me, I threw a shot back
I pour so much red up in the fego, turned the pop black
When it comes to niggas, out the picture, had to crop that
[?] real real strong, this that rock pack
[?] don't even smoke, he said [?] rolling up that opp pack
Caught him at that red light, like where your stupid ass [?]
[Verse 1: Siick P]
My Glock jam, gotta get the Mack
[?] I can't forget the mask
I was going to the stu, and I had skipped a class
I don't speak on what I do, these niggas quick to brag
Only thing I wanna do is go and get the bag
[?] hand it off to bro, cause he had missed [?]
I still focus on my future, [?] the passed
[?] bitch wanna be freaky, made her kiss the mac
Niggas call it being nice, but I just call it [?]
[?] we gon' leave when you fall to the ground
Fuck 12, need to free all my dawgs in the pound
Fuck with gang, we'll leave a nigga lost till he found
