Gang'll shoot you up, ain't none my niggas civil
Yeah, bitch
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Gang'll shoot you up, ain't none my niggas civil
I be up before them roosters, boy, yo chicken little
Snatched this Kitty off the lot, won't catch me in no rental
She let me in her jeans like DNA 'cause chicken in my denims
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I ain't beefing, see an opp and beat him like an instrumental
Hunnid puppies sitting in the kitchen, damn, this bitch a kennel
Sliding in the Demon, bet they hear it when I hit the pedal
Diamonds on my neck, buffs on and my wrist a bеzel
[Verse 3: TrDee]
If the money calling, I'ma push thе pedal
Up the stick, now it's a dot on him, gave him a freckle
Fucked his bitch, had him sick as fuck and kicking pebbles
I'm a busy man, I'll let you know if you fit in my schedule
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Unky wasted off the juice, this double coffee cup got Wocky
Yo bitch see what's in my bank account, I bet she fuck me probably
All our heads be wrapped up in designer when I'm up with akhi
Skate around with sticks like Gretzky, none my niggas fuck with hockey
