[Intro]
Man, lemme spell BabyTron for you real quick, T-H-R-U-S-T
Bitch and my pieces hit like UFC
I ain’t even gon' play with y’all this time I swear to god
(ShittyBoyz)
[Verse 1]
Hoes on my dick, "Who this white boy in this nice fit?"Bitch I’m mixed, only thing white is these ice sticks
Tight drip, Amiris hit for 2, that’s some light shit
Fight who? This an
XD
, you can’t fight this
I ain’t lost with this punch, feel like Mayweather
Yeah that’s yo bitch, but she said that I taste better
C-R-U-M-B, bitch you’re them 5 letters
Bro came up off stealing shit like he Kawhi Leonard
Came a long way from the last pick on the court
Cause now I ball, bitch I’m tapped in with thе source
6 for the shoes, stеp on these, you gettin' horsed
Still ain’t seen the firefighters since I dropped "Human Torch"
(Where they at?)
Do the Cha-Cha when I touchdown like Victor Cruz
Had no bitches, but now I get to pick and choose
Got it off the strength, baby that’s what that chicken do
Fuck yo dead mans, run up on us, you get lifted too
Pull yo head out yo ass and use yo fuckin' brain (What?)
These hoes gon' leave you in the cold when it start to rain (All facts)
Pocket full of visas, but my heart full of pain (It is)
BabyTron, I live my best life, got it off the strength (Bitch I’m livin')
You love the ‘gram, so at least flash some money on it (Please)
And if I hear about the bucks then I’m like Giannis
Soul left my body, had to grab the big bonnet
Put that .40 to his back, Shawn Kemp, SuperSonic
Bro a warrior, so don’t make me call Brandon up
Don’t do shit for yo team, call him Brandon Rush
ShittyBoyz, ShittyBoyz, bitch you can’t scam with us
We don’t rap beat, but you can go ahead and challenge us
And if you do that, that’s yo whole career (Huh?)
Bro came in horsin' like he Paul Revere (What?)
Had who runnin'? That shit just missed my ears
Laughin' at the opps, you won’t catch me with a trace of
fear
Only child, I ain’t ever had a big bro (On my own)
Balencis tight as hell, fuckin' up my big toe (Goddamn)
She lookin' at my jeans, cause she see my shit swole
Swiper no swiping, hit the store on my tip-toes (I’m outta there)
Can’t even tell you what I’m doin' up on CashApp
If you went and checked out my ‘gram, you wouldn’t ask that
Wide receiver, catchin' plays, bitch, fuck a halfback
The opps can’t match clothes, but I bet they match [?]
Always been a playmaker, put me at the 1 (Cha-cha-ching)
Talkin' shit on the mic, need a pack of gum (Damn)
Heard I was BabyTron, now I’m smackin' buns
Bro fell in love with the glizzy, tote the strap for fun (Ba-boom)
Coach used to put me out cause my attitude (Fuck that nigga)
I still shit talk, bitch and I’m still rude
"BabyTron ain’t really up" yeah, I hear you
Imma spit on you soon as I hit my Clear Fruit
Nike Tech, [?] pocket full of dogshit (It is)
Other pocket full of visas and they all hit (Hitters)
Punched up some Yeezys for my bitch on some small shit
Look at the roll, lil baby, this bitch all strips
Walked in the store, and this bitch jaw dropped
"Are you BabyTron", I said "Yeah", then her heart stopped
Hunnid dollar worth of snacks, cause I knew the card rocked
Puttin' 2 on 2 and you wonder why yo car stopped (Fuckin' lame)
I got some killers down the way who stay in Apple Ridge
And if a .223 hit yo stomach, then it’s cracking ribs
Exquisite drip, I can’t tell you what the jacket is
But might catch a [?] the way that he flashin' sticks
Could’ve bought the meech, but I like the old school
Had who shook? I’d smack the shit out old dude
I won’t throw a jab, but Ipsy Clay’d fold you
BabyTron, I’m the goat, could’ve swore I told you
