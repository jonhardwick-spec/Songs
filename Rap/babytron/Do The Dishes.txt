[Intro: BabyTron]
Whew
Hey, ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, long live $cam, you know?
(Hey)
If it's up we gon'-, whew, ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
If it's up we gon' stomp him through the ceilin'
750 tucked only if you knew the feelin'
Done leakin' sauce, only thing they do is stealin'
Gettin' high I'm so fly, you'd prolly think I do the dealin'
The geek kit do the healin'
You won't hear me with no pigs, let the whip do the squealin'
On the same side, let the blick do the switchin'
Make your BM sweep the floor, then it's time to do the dishes
[Verse 2: Certified Trapper]
The hoеs, the money, the cars and thе clothes come
Stretch gang granny, with they opps she will fold some
Brrt, mop, mop, mop, where you gon' run?
Bitch givin' top, top, top, it's like foursome
Panoramic roof in this bitch, I can see the 'burbs
Blurred vision off the perc, I can't read the words
I been puttin' shit to work like it hit the first
Nigga wanna send a threat, make him eat the words
