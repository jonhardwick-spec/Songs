[Verse 1: Brisco Bands]
Runnin' to the bag like a motherfuckin' track meet
Please don't act up, I'ma blow you back with that heat
Foreign whip drivin', digi' dash, do the max speed
Movin' like I'm spec ops, you will never catch me
Flexin' in my Gucci draws, Bobby Lashley
Hoes love me 'cause they say a nigga fashy
Designer all up on me, lookin' smoother than Max B
All my shooters ridin' with me down to the chassis
Y'all smokin' on that boof pack, that's so nasty
Love a ghetto booty, but you gotta act classy
Fuck her, now she screamin' 'til her voice get raspy
Used to call mе Brisco, now she call me daddy
Fuck all that crazy talk, drop the addy
Couldn't bе me, boy, that pussy shit past me
Told me you love me now, bitch, you is lyin'
Blow money fast, bitch, my pockets is flyin'
Told me you love me now, bitch, you is lyin'
Blow money fast, bitch, my pockets is flyin'
Do it with ease, bitch, I ain't even tryin'
Icy from head to toe, you see the shine
Get to the sack like I am the D-line
Give me two nickels, I only fuck dimes
Stay 'way from fakes 'cause I don't got the time
Snap on the beat then I pass it to Tron
