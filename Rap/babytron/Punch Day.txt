Reuel, stop playin' with these niggas

[Verse]
Jeff fucked around and poured a four of Wockiana Faygo twist
Fuck around and give an opp a halo when this Draco rip
Rollie with a dab of ranch on my Ayo, Teo shit
Shoppin' out in Cali', fucked around and had Rodeo lit
High as hell, high as fuck, I'm off exotic drugs
Trackhawks, Hellkitties, finna fuck the throttle up
Hop out on an opp and show his ass what I got bottled up
2017, young Tron had a lot of thrust
Pull up on your block and drop a fifty like a ball player
Back in middle school, ain't go to class, I was a hallwayer
I'll have you lookin' crazy if you wanna talk paper
Dropped out of college, 'cause they didn't have a fraud major
Flyin' through the Willow off a yerky, feelin' bulletproof
If I see an opp, I'm finna show 'em what these bullets do
Big man, you a lil' boy, bitch, I'll bully you
Flip the switch up on the Glocky, show you what thе fully do
Tsk, ridin' round with [?]
It's a punch day if you ever ridin' 'round with Tron
I might see a bean or two flip ridin' 'round with Ron
Tsk, don't gеt hit, I'm ridin' 'round with nine
Bitch, I'm...
