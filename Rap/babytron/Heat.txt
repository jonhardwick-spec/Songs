Triple S Balenciaga, kicks kinda heavy

Call my nigga Carl, told him [?] need a box of [?]
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
ShittyBoyz
They saying, "Tron and CJ should've dropped already"
At Ocean Prime, ask the waiter, "Is the lobster ready?"
Jacks out the ass, swear to God that these boxes heavy
Call my shooter "Kawhi", if he pull up then he dropping twenty
[Verse 3: OwnLane CJ]
I been running up a check, I been counting plenty
I’ma move my people out the crib and I'ma drop a Bentlеy
Told my teacher I ain't want a F unless I’m rocking Fеndi
How you popping out with the hoes and they got a penny?
Bitch ass fat, pussy good, hit it two times
Niggas really poor, probably can't afford my stu' time
Real juice, hit a light dub, pay for two lines
Nigga fuck around and get blew for playing two sides
