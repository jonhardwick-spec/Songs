[Intro]
(Enrgy made this one)
[Verse]
Heavy on the drank, light up on the pistol (Bah)
Heavy on the drank, boy, I don't need no ice
Tss, took his ice like, "Shit, you could keep your life"
Pfft, where you from? What you wearing? I ain't see your stripes
On the classic side of things, I'm in here pouring lean on Sprite
On the other side of things, might switch up to the cream soda
If I sip it, boy, it's red or purple, I don't drink Yoda
Tell him seek you, once he get to biting, throw my dawg a treat
Shit, turn your pocket inside out, I heard that talk is cheap
Wrist full of V's, call a plumber, it's a faucet leak
I got the full payment on me, I won't even talk a lease
Went and got it limo tinted, I'm just living cautiously
Out here sipping re-rock? You living life nauseously (Uh)
Twelve flicked the foreign and asked if I was smoking pot
Bro'll turn your Scatty to a striker if the door's unlocked (Skrrt)I just met Jorge at the loading dock
Road running, flying home like I got a show to watch
All I know in pour is drop (Brrt)
High as hell, I poured a four of Wock' by four o'clock (Damn)
If you know the spot then pull up, it's an open shop
Brodie catching bodies back to back to back to back to back to back, he need a golden chop (Brrt)
Warriors around me, this ain't Golden State
Cuddy route running, touching down like he Golden Tate
The worst thing to be, is stuck froze in place (Yeah)
Pull up to the scene, up pole and spray (Brrt)
Told the gang if it's up, I'm one phone away (Brrt)
My cleats tied, I'm in the field to jump on a play (Come here)
It's only ten AM, this blunt four today (Phew)
Bitch, I'm on my grind like I'm Tech Decking
I'll send them soldiers out like a text message
I remember Western Union with the test questions
I remember I ain't stacked a thing, that was the best lesson
I remember back when it was acky, I ain't sip quali' (Yeah)
You better purchase helmets, we don't shoot to hit bodies
Sick his Presidential ticking, he done copped a Mitt Romney
Designer wrapped around my head, clutching on the Drac', bitch, call me "big akhi"
In here wrestling with these RTAs, bitch, it might get sloppy (Shit)
On stage, I refuse to let you Chris Rock me (Shit)
All these damn cuss words, they can't KIDZ BOP me
All I gotta say is one word and it'll get choppy
V's on my neck, they dancing like a TikToker
Wake up, throw it on, I'm what you consider a drip dropper
I was horsing back in school, you got bullied and switched lockers (Lame)
This the winner's circle (Phew)
This ain't grape Kool-Aid, I'm in here sipping purple (Phew)
Every obstacle, shit, is getting hurdled (Phew)
We'll wet 'em with them shells, treat this bitch like Squirtle
(Phew)
I thought that you was out here scoring, show it (Brrt)
Expensive pants on my legs, Warren Lotas
(Brrt)
On the road off a P, hop in that Ford and focus
(Brrt)
In the lab with Lando, in here pouring potions (Brrt)
