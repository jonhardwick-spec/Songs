[Intro]
(
Damn, Tye, you made this bitch too?
)
[Verse 1: Prince Jefe]
Granny push a dub off her unemployment
Topside gettin' cut, seven in the morning
I had to take a lean break, we hit they block and scorch it
She gon' need a teammate, one ho get boring
[Verse 2: YSR Gramz]
Lil' bro out here scoring like he Michael Jordan
You ain't put enough in that 'Wood, you gotta roll a quarter
These niggas tellin', niggas law and order
Man these bitches ain't shit, I don't want no daughter
[Verse 3: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
Man, me and Boom back-to-back, we both blowin' pistols
Man, who the fuck can fuck with us when we start throwin' missiles?
Them .223s likе freak hoes, don't let thеm bitches kiss you
If I don't like a rap nigga, I'ma pull up, kill him, I ain't gon' fuckin' diss him
[Verse 4: The Godfather]
We pulled up back-to-back black trucks, hate when niggas act tough
Promoting violence, put the guns down and come get fapped up
Boom, why you killin' niggas? Better keep your neck tucked
I be out here steppin' on they heads, shit, who next up?
