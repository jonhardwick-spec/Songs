[Part I]
[Intro]
(
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse]
X on the Off-White tee like a treasure map
It's to the tops on my ceiling, you can't measure that
Talking 'bout you fly? Where yo feathers at?
I got a Goose on my back for the weather, Jack
I'm on a mission for the riches, feeling like the Goonies
BFG, unky working in the boonies
Life double G's so I played the Gucci
Pirates of the Caribbean, in the deep like the movie
Hutch kit, I got more gold than Blackbeard
Cannon on me, I'll knock yo stupid-ass to last year
On the quest to how I'm feeling, bitch, thе path clear
When that wave hit yo ship, I bеt you can't steer
Four of Wockiana looking like some Rum
I ain't point guard but I'm looking like the one
On the beach with a hun', I might fuck the island up
Blew a zip and I still ain't high enough
Make an opp jump up off that plank
Huh, I bet a shark ate him
Missed another package, I was off the drank
When they pull some ho shit, you feel yo heart changing
