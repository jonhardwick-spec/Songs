[Verse 1]
Gregory Helms, the way I'm dripping leave the Levi's broken
Wild cat formation, buddy, I got plenty motion
SKS'll pause him mid sentence like a semicolon
'Vetting in the Z06, you ever see me Chevy rolling
I sent some shots out this bitch like I'm Big30
Ice cream VVs got me froze like a McFlurry
Brodie sell so many blues and oranges, need a Knicks jersey
If the whip ain't '22 or newer, it ain't drift worthy
Fuck the easy way, I never care about using the stairs
They can't never take my spot from me, this ain't musical chairs
Backwoods and Quagen, heard yo combo a brew and a square
Ninety-nine percent of who be talking be shooting the air
Riding 'round with a rifle and a hunting license
Finna take one cup and put another cup inside it
Just know on the other side that the sun is shining
Everybody had something to say, becoming silent
Hit her from the back, you would've thought this bitch popped a bar
Shooter out his shit like, "Chill out, gang, man, that's not the car"
Pour a yeah by the deuce, I just Wocked my heart
Drop an album, get some popcorn and watch the charts
I'm just chilling at the [?] praying that they drop it
Nowadays every move big, weighing out the options
Heard this white boy don't miss, playin' like I'm Dončić
When it's money talk, doggy always changing up the topic
I can't breathe off the tree, this a chronic wheeze
If it's coins on the floor, I run around with Sonic speed
I don't know who fucking with the team, honestly
Seen every state, might hit space for an odyssey
Drunk a three then a five, you ain't odd as me
Tell a bitch like it's "prolly", not "probably"
I could have a mill' cash on me, wouldn't cop a plea
Probably won't understand a thing if it ain't Guapanese
Without the money I feel lonelier than AkonLonelier than Speaker Knockerz, glad I got some pape' now
With all these snakes that's around, can't relate now
Stay dangerous, it ain't no point in being safe now
Strapped my nuts on and did a great job
Said you want smoke with us? You must be laced, huh
Wave rider, you gon' go copy, paste, huh
West Coast Customs, pull up here and get a paint job
Buffed up, swinging sticks, feel like A-Rod
3 PM, fall asleep, that's a drank nod
I'm so high like, oh shit, hey, God
Fully switch glitch with a Glock, got a K mod
So much money off of BOA, you think I bank rob
Couldn't even touch the backboard, I can bang now
Would've memorized yo last four but I'm changed now
Slide around like the task force with them thangs out
Tuck yo kit, I'm with slimeballs and jankmeisters
I'm on go, fuck a break, you a take-fiver
Bullet sharper than a sword, this a brain slicer
Hunnid overall, I got the haters checkin' game sliders
Road running south, Raising Cane's then hit Zaxby's
This some top shelf, I'm a face, you can't match me
Red beams on it, thought his face had some acne
Habibi dropping crates full of bombs like he ACME
Spinning with the devil, Tasmanian
Performing MIAs, I could feel a stadium
Bitch, I'm damn near in the O, I caught a play in Adrian
Tron Brady, I'm a winner, we the Patriots
High as hell, I think I'm sinking in the couch
I'm a rude fuck, I be thinking with my mouth
Shit pretty simple, you just need some cheese to get a mouse
You twenty-three, you think yo mama want you sleeping in her house?
Fuck, shit, this that vintage Tron
Seven hunnid dollar hoop shorts, these some vintage Dons
Back in school you was the type that we was picking on
SBDSM, bitch, we been the mob
Ride around with Warzone shit, I could kill a squad
Four years later, bitch, we still them guys
Gotta take a pic, shit, I'm feeling fly
I ain't cool with my stash unless a mill' inside
Spent ten on Melrose, killing time
I don't play the fake game, shit, I'm real with mine
Selling bow thangs, whole thangs, we don't deal with dime
All the shit I dodged, I thank God that I'm still alive
