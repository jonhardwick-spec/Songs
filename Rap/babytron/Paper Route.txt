[Intro: BabyTron]
I can't open up my heart, ayy
I can't open up my heart, ayy
I can't open up my heart, hell nah, I can't open up my heart

[Chorus: BabyTron]
I can't open up my heart
It was dark in the deep, playing with them sharks
Playing in the dark, bitches playing with my heart
So, hell nah, bitch, I can't open up my heart
Open up my heart? I'd rather open bank accounts
Fraud of the rap, pray that we make it out
On the road, dodging hate on the paper route
Open up my heart? Bitch, open a bank account
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Karma snuck on me like a hiccup
Don't ask what's the score, nigga, we up
[?] put yo seat up
Turn his block to Kalahari, bro wet the street up
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
More pain, that's an extra bar to the face
Wearing BAPE in Chase, that's an extra shark in the bank
OT with some extra cards and they blank
In a foreign whip, that's an extra star in the Rafe
