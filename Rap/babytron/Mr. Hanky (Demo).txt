Lyrics from Snippet
[Intro]
Shittyboyz
Fuck, shit, damn
You're not making this easy Kyle
[Verse]
Heard they tryna take me as the nice guy, nice try
Double A twelve, pulled up turned his block to Five Guys
I got hippie lungs, gallery department tie-dye
Real life spaceships we ain’t livin' Sci-Fi
I can tell she wanna fuck, doin' all that side eye'n
Tryna take half a dollar from me, you gon' die trying
Off an oxy hittin’ stains, bitch I feel like Billy Mays
Million dollar game yeah, I'm the king, I'm in my ghillie phase
I'm the shit like Mr. Hanky
Shoot the .38 with both hands the trigger janky
Hangin' out the window if it's issues, I ain't goin on a rant
2 Grams short a half, in the slabs Za Morant
Scratchin' opps off the list, that shit like stompin' ants
Shoulda knew that brick fake, shit ain't even got a stamp
Mountain Dew on lava lamp, if he hide ain’t gotta camp
Number one contender put me in the ring i'll drop the champ
Lil' brodie manned up and volunteered to hit the ten
One ho getting boring, told that bitch get a friend
Serenede jeans stack, these is not no RTA's
Fuck a ARP, I pull up clean the scene with RBK
This life shit up and down, kinda like a seesaw
Aston Martin with the horses pull off in a yeehaw
Throw yo' album in the dumpster, that shit sounded week sauce
Every card of the deck, I ain't take no weeks off
Everyday of the calendar, I'm pickin' up what you put down like I got scavenger
I ain't got no shame in my game Frank Gallagher
Why they count me out, I shocked the world, supreme chancellor
Hundred in the clip twenty-five each, cause we ride around with three passengers
