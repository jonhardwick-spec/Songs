[Intro: BabyTron &
DaBoii
]
Bitch, yeah
Fuck, shit, damn
Huh, yeah (
Tron, what we on, nigga?
)
Nigga, on the gang
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Three-five of Space Runtz, I'm floating like a astronaut
Twenty in my Ksubis, finna walk inside Saks and shop
You talking big money shit but you don't have a knot
Buffs white as hell, same time got the blackest pop
Hunnid rounder, ahki sliding, finna whack a opp
Two chains bust, next month finna grab a watch
Gucci windbreaker, shoes, and the matching socks
If you in the field, young boy, you better grab a Glock
[Verse 2: DaBoii]
Yeah, if you in the field, young boy, you better grab straps
Chains wet, send them bad hoes, I been had that
I'll let off the first shot and get the last laugh
And when I whip that big bitch out, bettеr back-back
Bitch keep telling me she miss mе, with her sad-ass
Pull up on yo block like Lamar, where the stash at?
I'll strip a nigga out his pockets and his Cash App
Bitch keep tryna suck my dick, where the cash at?
