[Intro: StanWill]
I got money, I got power, show me my respect (
Prince, this a hit
)
Up the AR long as Teddy, playin' with that check
Boy, huh, four thousand on our face, the Cartis buffy, all my niggas flex
[Verse 1: StanWill]
We at Fleming, steak and calamari with my ho
I'm with the Militia, but we army with the poles
Hottest out, it's funny I was starvin' in the cold
All these fuckin' money bags, I bet you Ari give me dome
Lookin' at my life, they like, "How far he finna go?"
R.I.P. my motherfuckin' baby, think 'bout Mari when I pour
Seent it all, I had Amir tint the Cartis on a ho
She be doin' tricks, your bitch be gettin' gnarly with the throat
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Ballin' in the isolation, catch him out, annihilation
Doggy flaggin' in the fiеld, penalize and violate him
What I got, you can't buy it, it's a gift
Hundrеd shots in a minute, this a switch
I know it's on the floor when my palms get that itch
Shoot the ball, it's a swish, watch me call in the blitz
If it's on the floor, I bet I fall on that shit
Was a wizard in my prime, John Wall with the glitch
[Verse 3: StanWill]
S to the B, ain't in no stall when I shit
DSM, bitch, it's funny, all my dogs got that shit
Hundred shots, we gon' slide until they callin' it quits
On my balls like my dick, I had a ball with his bitch, huh
I might fall down, could never fall off
Claimin' you a dog, bet my dogs get you dog-walked
Playin' with the gang got 'em paused, now they all chalk
Started with a crawl, I can't jog 'til we all walk
