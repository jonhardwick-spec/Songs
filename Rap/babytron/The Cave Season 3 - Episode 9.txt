[Intro: Derek Green &

Wakin' up on VenusPlaying games up on the starsPlaces you have dreamed of, solve the mystery on MarsYou can stop believin' in the things you've never seenLeave another dimension when you're ridin' down the scene
(
Whoa, Kenny
)
Huh, yeah
[Verse]
Shot down from Melrose to link up with Kenny Beats
When I touch down in the D, straight to Eddie V's
Two Tron's busts, next week gon' be heavy links
Hit his pint with Karo but I bet he sleep
Lil' bitch all on my dick, told her, "Let me be"
Hibachi every day in LA, it's a Beni's week
AF1 crackheads, call 'em "Nelly sneaks"
Unc' dropped a fiend, you can catch him where the fetty be
Punch God'll get you killed for a iPhone method
Out in Cali, in a different time zone flexin'
Hit him with a K like I'm side ho textin'
Pourin' lines of red, bitch, this the typo section
Bro cookin' ice, got the Walter White recipe
Four  Wockyana, bitch, I don't like Hennessey
Mix it with a V cut, that's the right remedy
Talkin' 'bout a dub? I made that times seventy
First class, bitch, I'm damn near in the cockpit
Big cuz stay with a key like a locksmith
Back then I was always thinkin' like I got this
Reach for a chain? You gon' die, that is not this
Throwin' scam money in the club, make her rake it up
White buffs, mirror tints, got 'em straight from Hutch
Could've paid yo' rent but I paid for lunch
Aunt Jemima in my cup, pourin' maple up
Sleeve Nash, Luka Trončić, I'm a team player
Could've scooped in the Scat but I'm a Stingray her
Like a art teacher, I got blue, green, and pink paper
Probably ain't winnin' if you don't see haters
Before the rap, ran it up off the dark web
BAPE hoodie, cost a band for the shark head
Told the bitch half my heart gone, other part dead
How the fuck you gon' slide? Boy, yo' car dead
