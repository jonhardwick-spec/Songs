Meech

[Chorus]
When it comes to the money, I'm a magnet
Crib so big, I'm lost in it like a labyrinth
Motionless, doggy bone, he just stagnant
I work magic, now my pape' giant, Hagrid (Ooh)
When it comes to havin' class, your bitch absent (Fah-fah)
Now he's got a surgeon pickin' out the fragments
Bank account off some uppers, but I'm movin' off relaxants
Everything I ever did, they went and try to reenact it (Why?)
[Verse]
They done let them steppers in, fuck 12
Told neph' we can't watch no
Peppa Pig
Palm Angels leopard print
Lil' boy, you delicate, my lil' ho, she elegant
How the fuck you choose to lose instead of win?
Life a book and we gon' hit 'em with that Exodus (Ha)
Talkin' 'bout in the hood, you off of Exit 6
Dub, dub, dub, shit, I moved on from deficits
Zip of snowballs like they came from Mount Everest
We gotta move the body 'fore the block start smellin' it
Sold, not told, but I ain't finna start sellin' it
Put the money on the floor and we gon' start sendin' it
Savin' pros, when it comes to them, I'm Clark Kent-ing it
I'll put a bullet in your ass for all that hardheadedness
Somewhere by the skybox, I'm out far sendin' blitz
You can't find us on Earth, I'm on Mars spending strips (Nyoom, hey)
Re-up on the first, by the third, it's slim pickings
You would think the city Salem, shit, it get wicked
When I pop a fifteen, shit, I get ignant
When I double down on 'em, shit, I get vicious
Walk out, the kit kittin' and the 'fit fittin'
Dog finna pull his hair out 'cause his bitch bitchin'
Cuddy in the kitchen, ain't no master, he just quick mixin'
Lookin' at some flicks from back then, hear the pigs' hisses
Can't find us on the kids' menu, this big chicken
Grinnin' through the venue 'cause we just got the blick in it
Chop in the joggy, it'll get rugged in Ruggero
AMGs and TRXes, we ain't comin' in Camaros
Rio de Janeiro, or should I hit an island?
For old times' sake, should I go and hit Verizon?
Should I?
Gold-diggin' bitch want diamonds, well, she better get to minin', ShittyBoyz
