Yeah
[Verse 1: AK Bandamont]
I'm in Detroit with BabyTron, I'm eatin' lambchops
The nigga thought he was gon' kill me, then the jammed Glock out
Mean his Glock jammed, and then he got his head popped
And if I pull that chopper out, you know it got the red dot
Huh, tried to spin me back in the day, but she a fan now, huh
They ain't think I was gon' make it, look how it fanned out
Now everywhere I go, they know me, and I got bands out
Brodie tryna overkill him, he shoot chop until it ran out
Hit the titty bar and throw up ones until it ran out
He was sneak-dissin' in songs, the nigga dead now, it's how it is
I remembеr I was broke, I'm gettin' bread now, it's how I livе
I remember pushin' Chevs 'round, but it is now Benz (Skrrt)
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Take my experimented pop and pull it out the fridge
She gon' call you in a minute when I pull it out her ribs
If I never got the down payment, pull from out the gig
Boy, your team down twenty, why you pullin' up from mid?
I ain't gotta leave to make a ticket, pull it out the crib
Used to drive that lil' Honda, now I'm pullin' up some big
Heard you want some smoke, it's on the floor, we pullin' up with SIGs
Doggy actin' like a bitch, I caught him pullin' up his wig
Twenty blunts up in the car, ain't pullin' up with Wiz
This a grown-man sport, don't pull up with no kids
When we in the booth, it's all fact, don't pull up with no fibs
I ain't nowhere near it, ain't no point in pullin' up the grid
