[Intro: StanWill]
Yeah
[Verse 1: StanWill &
BabyTron
]
Spin the 'Cat till I'm motion sick
Tin Man in this Chrome Heart, I'm emotionless
I ain't stepping out the crib 'less the pole equipped
Can't believe she shot a shot, I'm finna ho this bitch
[Verse 2: StanWill]
How yo baby popping out the cut, it's like I'm C-section
On my back a X but my sneaks, they got three S's
How you in that water but was never in the deep section?
Taking over 2022, bitch, we gon' keep pressing
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Popping out with big chicken, Foghorn Leghorn
Mister Back It Up, bitch, I talk more, spend more
Unky dropping fiends off that,, he the fent' lord
Why you playing checkers? Bitch, wе moving on the chessboard
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Road running, live a tour lifе, feel like Uzi
Pink Runtz in the 'Wood, one puff, brodie woozy
Treat yo baby like I'm Brian, nickname yo bitch "Stewie"
Bitches tryna get behind the scenes 'cause my life a movie
