[Intro: StanWill]
Yeah
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Knocking on a opp door, we 'bout to blow his crib down
X on my Off-White tee when I spin 'round
Went in Somerset with twenty racks and left with ten thou'
Flash the rackies at her, she gon' undress and bend down
Once I get the neck I gotta bounce, I ain't staying with you
19X, be done blew you with a tan pistol
Walking outta Loose Cannon, I done left some bands in it
Gotta know it's new season drip, you see Stan in it
Big Track.2s, you won't catch me in no pair of Crocs
Balling-ass swiper, bitch, I'm feeling like De'Aaron Fox
Hopping out like Max Payne, busting with a pair of Glocks
Pull up tryna fight? Bitch, I triple dog dare a opp
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Lemon, Black Cherry, plug came with Gelato flavors
Mossberg shells everywhere, I'm a taco maker
BIN Master, more numbers on me than a lotto player
You was class clown, nowadays you ain't got no paper
Vroom, I'll fuck around and make this bitch zoom
Unky in the kitchen, blue nose, not no Shih Tzu
Chopstick, hunnid rounder beam with the grip too
Walk down season, I ain't doing no jiu-jitsu
Ahki got a turban, I be sliding in a balaclava
Triple S stepping, see an opp, he getting stomped in 'iagas
Talking money, why the fuck yo bank account ain't got a comma?
Widebody or the lil' coupe, no, this is not a Honda
