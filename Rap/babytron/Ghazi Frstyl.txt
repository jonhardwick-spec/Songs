[Intro: $camurion]
(
Enrgy made this one
)
Yeah, 72, gang-gang
Yeah
[Verse 1: $camaurion]
I'm off a bean, feel like Bean, why would I pass the rock?
Bitch hella water, playin' with fire like the Avatar
I'm from the D, just hit the bay, damn near seen some sharks
Told gang, "Scratch that corner if he see the narcs"
Niggas only tough on the web, shit like Peter Park
Can't talk to me about no pills, ain't never seen a Bart
Shit, got your bitch ridin' Wraith like she ain't seen the stars
Fuck, told your bitch, "Give me space", you can't come to Mars
It's up, you ain't never seen a thirty-piece all large
Fuck, sippin' on that yellow lean, might just call Marge
Nigga actin' up in Neiman's, get the mall sparked
Lame nigga workin' with the people, it's givin' Paul Blart
[Verse 2: MJPAID]
With this six, I can punch you, it's a [?] cart
Talkin' 'bout the ups, nigga, what about the fall apart?
In Margiela in the stu', this shit all art
Rollin' 'Wood after 'Wood and they all dark
Fifty chops posted in the picture and they all spark
Nigga save it for the bitch, I should call Bart
Twenty miles left up in the rental, hittin' Walmart
Twenty bills stuffed up in the skinnies and they all large
In the field, hit your bitch up out the ballpark
You got the poles with no pape', that's what you call hard?
So many stats up in the store, I'm an all star
More catches in the striker, bitch, we safety in it all cards
