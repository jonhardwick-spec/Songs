Lyrics from
Snippet
[Verse]
...Shit, my tolerance too high, nah, it ain't no matching with me
Multiplying dividends, that boy ain't got a fraction with it
Say my name three times, I'm poppin up like Candyman
My jeweller ain't playin' no games, but diamonds, they on Candyland
My bitch pussy macaroni, plus she got the candy yams
She could be up at hospice, still'll get yo' granny scammed
Callin' me to fix the problem? Must think I'm the handyman
Practicin' my speech for when I win, I'm in my Grammy bag
That'll be yo' last supper, boy, it's fetty on that Tupperware
I don't think I'm leavin', triple here, but I'mma double there
Boy, it's time to grow the fuck up, it's hard to hustle scared
Heard thеy couldn't stand me, we gon' need more than a couplе chairs
Cuddy on the road, a thousand pieces like he solvin' puzzles
I was tired of the noise, I grabbed the chop and bought a muzzle
Pfft-pfft-pfft-pfft, now they all in trouble
[?] plug on Westbrook, should I call him Russell?
This one for the history books
Gang bendin' minivan to show you how a mystery look
Lil' brodie, he a gremlin, call him Gizmo
Feel like Marley, caught him fishbowl tryna get home
Bitch head eleven out of...
