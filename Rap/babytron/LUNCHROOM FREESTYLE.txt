[Verse 1: NASAAN]
Yeah, yeah, Magic City war, man, he poor, I can't see the floor
Groupie ho on tour, press record, finna shoot a porn
Money 6'4'', Michael Jordan, out here grabbing boards
Still, I got Dior I ain't wore sittin' in the drawer
Hit her off a whistle, busted on her nipple
Saany sayin', "
Error
," ooh, don't make me giggle
I've been moving state to statе, traveling, I forgot to dribble
If a nigga out herе talking crazy, turn him to a widow
I was made for this shit, slaved for this shit
Mama prayed for this shit, know I prayed for this shit
Famous beach hoes, they tryna ride a wave on my dick
Bitch ugly, tryna get my 'Gram, gave her my Kik
If she give the pussy up more, she bound to see me less
I get tricky with the steel though like ridin' BMX
Fuck around and make this K pop, look like we BTS
We gon' stop 'em, drop 'em, shut 'em down, DMX
Nigga, I ain't come to flex, I really came to ball like LaVar
Wait, I think I'm dizzy, in the double R, seeing stars
Get her out her drawers like a jar like they wrote a law
Nigga touch lil' bro, spin his block, then I'm callin' Saul
