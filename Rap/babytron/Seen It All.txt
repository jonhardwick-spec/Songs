[Chorus: BabyTron]
SB, bitches scream when we leave the mall
Hundred punches on the site, yeah, we need them all
Ten 201s, boy, this the Visa walk
Can't tell us nothing 'bout this shit, we done seen it all
Huh, I done seen the best, I done seen the worst
Ain't no heart in my chest, I done felt the hurt
All these cards on my dick, finna test them first
Put them sharks on his head, bet that the pressure work
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Sauce God, no, you can't have the recipe
Powered up, tell them boys match this energy
Bitch got a strap with her, Katniss Everdeen
Wasn't in school, I was at the scam assembly
I can teach how you to punch, teach you how to slide
I can't teach how you to punch if you ain't gon' ride
Stomach pains that I had turned to Ocean Prime
Might seem human but I swear it's a GOAT inside
Before I ran it up, had to try walking
Fell down and came up, I got hydraulics
Life free, living great 'cause my slides awesome
Five dummies run up then that's five coffins
At the MGM, tripping on the seventh floor
Nah, I don't drop beef but I'll drop yo credit score
Play with me? Heaven doors what you heading towards
Good lava work, swear to God that this method scorch
