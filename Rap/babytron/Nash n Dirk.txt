[Intro]
Marc Boomin, this you?
Enrgy made this one
[Verse: Brezden &
BabyTron
]
Damn, I'm in the Lab like I'm workin' out with Chris Brickley
Rick Owens, I just got them hoes for six-fifty
I know you mad 'cause your bitch look like Miss Piggy
I'm in the D livin' life, so my 'fit crispy
Transformin' in that 'Maro, Sam Witwicky
Had to pick the rap up, the scams get risky
You ain't never had the clerk bag six giffies
I ain't never trap, but I got a half a brick with me
Thinkin' you can get with me? You off crack and Percs
Me and BabyTron in this bitch, we like Nash and Dirk
I was too geeked, couldn't talk, had to scratch the verse
Reachin' for a chain and we gon' put him in the grass and dirt
You ain't a robber, at the most, probably snatch a purseWe gon' go to Neimans for the jeans then hit Saks for shirtsYou would never win, first to leave and the last to workOn our way to Mars, we done checked off planet Earth
We might go to Neptune, Mars, gotta do the dash
Talkin' so much shit that we just made the computer crash
But it's back up and we talkin' shit again
White boy, I be catchin' plays, Brian Finneran
'Xotic got me chokin' like a teaspoon of cinnamonThis the Murder Mitten, gotta keep tool in MichiganLive what you preach or I'ma think you a hypocriteUnless you talkin' pape', I'ma think you illiterate
My bitch eat it up, she get messy like she scribblin'
Knew her butt fake, but still fucked, I'm a gremlin
Try to trap me, keep a Jimmy, still dribblin'
Walk the beat down, just like some motherfuckin' Timberlands
We let them boys do the startin', we do finishin'So much Quagen in the room, might pour it out and swim in itBein' broke a joke, funny guy, why you gigglin'?I can't even fuck your bitch for real 'cause she keep wigglin'
Came and I was wiggle, but the bitch still ate me up
I be shot-blockin', I won't let a bitch lay me up
Oh, you think that you can fuck with me? You a crazy fuck
Out-of-town Hibachi, for a plate, pay eighty bucks
Juice plug, drink me up, 'za man, wake me upLife is a dream and I don't think y'all can wake me upHoes crazy, how this bitch tryna make me fuck?I can't bring lil' cuddy out the crib, he love janky stuff
I be lockin' shit like Kawhi, you can't shake me up
Za to the motherfuckin' za finna take me up
I'ma touch a M, call my granny and say, "We up"
First team, all NBA, I'm like Shai or somethin'
Get off your ass and go and hustle, lil' lazy buttYeah, I got my change up, but didn't let it change me upLast drive of the game, yeah, I'm Brady clutchWe'll put your whole family in the box, Brady Bunch
But it's fuck Tom Brady, I'm a Falcons fan
Look in granny crib, you gon' find a couple pounds and pans
If they find the striker, shit, it's probably AlcatrazTemple and above, guarantee my shooter scalp his ass
I be talkin' shit like, "Fuck a beat, I should have battle rap"
Real cash cow, I swear, I'm finna bring the cattle back
Actin' like a killer, only got a stripe on battle passTRX, it got so many horses, where the saddle at?
Puttin' belt to ass, I think I'm finna bring the paddle back
Super skinny, lookin' like the fucker from the Apple Jack
Stop playin' with me, ARP up in the satchel bagSlidin' down this block, you risk your life, do not gamble that
Shit up in my satchel, I'm pitchin' plays like I'm Satchel Paige
Talkin' big shit like Meek Mill when he had the braids
Let's see how fly I get and hope that I land the planeMe and Brez blew 'em out the water, shit, that's the game
