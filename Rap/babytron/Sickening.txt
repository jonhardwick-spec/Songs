[Verse]
Dog shit on me, ShittyBoyz jump shitty
They wanna front like it wasn't always "fuck Jimmy"
I heard it's up with me, shit, then it's stuck with me
Jack Man turning in, got my plug litty
Boy, I'm good on the East, ask Reese and [?]
For that cheese, square him up like a pizza box
Off-White flip-flops, I ain't need no socks
I don't know why the fuck I'm skinny, boy, I eat a lot
Huh, got a death threat in all caps
Huh, how fitting, it was all cap
Was in school acting bad, wasn't a hall pass
I'm the type to score, you'll pass the ball back
In New York with a torch like the statue
"BabyTron hit his bitch? That man smooth"
Ha-ha, I'm finna pass you
Stick poking through the BAPE, ain't no bamboo
Huh, fuck around, you get bamboozled
Huh, one shot'll get yo mans noodled
Unc' selling that, this ain't no damn poodle
I beat him with my right so I had off-hand shoot him
7-3-4 to the city, this for Ypsi
All blue strips on me, bitch, this for Nipsey
Made a hundred in this fit, boy, this for Dickiеs
Boy, I'm the Punch God, bitch, this for shippies
Boy, you like thirty-somеthing, never upped the fifty
Bro'll give him thirty-something if he up the glizzy
Fit cost thirty-hun' so I'm jumping shitty
Bring a ladder to his block since it's up there with me
If you think that bitch loyal, use yo head
We was not locked in, you ain't use my pegs
Bitch don't give head? It's dead
Could've came all dubs, did the blues instead
I just want head, if you playing then I'm heading out
Dickhead, pull out money just to spread it out
Knew me yo whole life, you wanna wrestle now?
Can't afford Off-White but guarantee I X you out
Huh, no cap, you a fucking bum
Oh, my bad, you're a fucking crumb
"Man, I hate BabyTron", probably 'cause I'm up
If I catch yo fat-ass out, I'ma fuck you up
White 1s, white tee, and some BAPE shorts
I think I know why you hate me, 'cause yo pape' short
My shooter from the Taliban like he hate pork
Somewhere chilling with my feet up by a lake shore
Can you put that money down? Dude, it ain't yours
Burnt the whole store down, sick I cam torch
White buffs, rose tint, sick I came dork
Grab an opp by his dreads, sick I came horse
