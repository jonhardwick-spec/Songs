[Intro]
Bitch, yeah
Sipping Actavis, I ain’t playing, yeah
Sipping Actavis, I, yeah
Sipping Actavis, ayy
What? You ain’t seen real VV—? Yeah
[Verse]
What? You ain’t seen real VVS?
Unky made a hundred out the Greenfield CVS
Ex bitch down bad, surprised she ain’t need me yet
Amiri jeans, B22s, I know you see me wet
Buffs on, bodybuilder, bitch, you gon’ see me flex
Red and blue tint on the lens, this a 3D set
Hit Chase with a fluke, that’s a easy check
Stack it up, young dawg, you can’t be me yet
At this point I don’t talk, the beat talk to me
If I don’t scoop girly, bet that she gon’ walk to me
Punch God, made a quick dub off a piece
Cuz damn near got a kеnnel, bully off the leash
I ain’t lying, got thе—, and we got the yeah
Traffic light pints, green, yellow, and we got some red
In my Vlone with the fam, I ain’t got no friends
Paranoid, woke up out my sleep, damn near shot the bed
Shooting moves, whip tinted, I’m just blowing Cookie
If we catch doggy in traffic, we gon’ get to blowing fully
I ain’t got a heart, my baby had to go and Chrome the hoodie
Star player, swear to God that I was feeling GOAT as rookie
Smiling at the top, I proved everybody wrong
When you down, I swear to God, it feel like everybody gone
Backwood, Backwood, bitch, everybody blown
Ice, ice, everybody froze
You better get a lawnmower, everybody snaking
Reminiscing ‘bout the past, like, everybody changing
ShittyBoyz
, we in the club, bitch, everybody raining
One thing you gotta know is not everybody make itNot everybody famous, not everybody greatnessWaited on my time, you gotta know not everybody patient
Trackhawks, Hellcats, it look like everybody racing
Whole gang look Asian, bitch, everybody facing
Million dollar thoughts, billion dollar dreams
If the team down two, best believe I got a three
Two thousand dollar SBs, you cannot rock these sneaks
In my ‘Miris off a ten, I ain’t popping jeans
They don’t hear me though, mask up, Mysterio
Talking ‘bout his bitch fucking? Well that’s yo theory, bro
On the road irritated at that Siri ho
PUA baller, I can tell that you clearly broke
Quite frankly I can tell that you need some help
Yeah, the dubs feel good, but dude, you gon’ see some Ls
Pull up with a chop chalupa clip, make him eat a shell
Caught doggy in my ashtray tryna reach for tails
I don’t sell weed, you want some? Better bring a scale
Back door season, slide through, we ain’t ring his bell
Quick ten, seven off of—, other three from Zelle
Told my bitch, “We going shopping when the lady bring the mail”
I can’t be fucked with on a bad day
Even one of them, I wake up and I bag chase
Heartbreak kid, I’ll leave her with a sad face
Tryna keep up? Boy, yo' dumbass in last place
Tryna keep up? Boy, you need to get yo' shit together
Charged up two times, lil’ bitch, the whip a Tesla
So much ice on my body, damn near switch the weather
Gang and ‘nem’ll, and flip the clip wherever
