[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
Nyah
Tuh, ha
[Chorus]
If I don't like your energy, you gotta go
Adios, hit the door, bye-bye
Hotspot for the cameras, trap ain't got no wi-fi
I'm on Mars in a spaceship, my life a sci-fi
[Verse 1]
They was sleepin' on us, woke 'em up like a nightmare
In the club, finna fuck it up like Icewear
Get your head in the game if you think life's fair
Thuggin' in my black forces, pop out in a white pair
AC crankin', blew some ash in my eye
They ain't even hell bake it, but want half of the pie
Call me what you want, just don't call me
Askin' 'bout a sixteen, it ain't a small fee
Whether it's a pint or a vеrse, you gon' get taxed
I can tеll a spirit left his body off the impact
Buckle up and sit back or you gon' catch some whiplash
Unky in the kitchen, finna hit girl like kick ass
I don't skip lag, I ain't skipped since I skipped class
Life a rollercoaster, ever been to Six Flags?
Livin' in a zipped bag, I don't mind the dark
Product of the jungle, came up out it with a lion heart
Guaranteed that I'ma grind, finish line the start
Every project that I drop seems to climb the charts
You won't find love from me, ain't no "I" in heart
Opened up the turkey bag, it smellin' like a fart
Mixin' shrooms with the Quagy-agy, I'ma barf
Jefe off of yellow, skatin' 'round just like he Bart
Give the snitches life, free my guys behind the bars
Rap star, somewhere in the hood with five diamond charms
