[Intro: BabyTron]
Helluva Beats, baby
Bitch
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Intoxicated off the Wocky driving, I might Paul Walker
All ballers, gang in Hutch chains, bitch, we all water
Threw a leash on that bitch, I might just dogwalk her
Boy, you better have a big bag, tryna talk offers
If he got the crazy eyes, I'm shooting like I'm Bobby Portis
Always thought your unc' was big dog 'til he got extorted
Shooter caught him sliding in a shooter and he shot his Taurus
Off-Weezy, Virgil type shit if I drop the Jordan's
SBDSM, you ain't tied in
Expensive habits, first class when I fly in
Talking 'bout you jack-catching, you ain't even five in
Backdoor season, I might fuck around and slide in
[Verse 2: TrDee]
I ain't finna battle rap with niggas, I ain't Cassidy
He don't got a brain, he only think to cause some casualties
I ain't texting back, I think that all my bitches mad at me
You can't hit no one, you better off hitting the lottery
M's on my mind, shit, I kinda feel like Majin Buu
Telling lies just to get between like I won't lie to you
Out in Cali' tripping hoes bad, whip got no roof
Why would I buy a method off you when I got it too?
Love to make some money and to make these niggas hate me
BAPE hoodie on me, I done went and paid a KG
Get another nigga, I'm just knowing that they ain't me
I can't switch teams, baby, I am not no KD
