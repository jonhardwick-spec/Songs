[Intro: DaeMoney]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: DaeMoney]
Ayy, you know I'm locked in
You know Deal, that's my Glock twin
It's a good game if my niggas get you boxed in
I know I'm the one, don't give a fuck about no top ten
I turned up out of nowhere on these niggas like a pop quiz
Rolex, gold patch, yeah, the watch Wiz
They say, "So you ballin'?" I say, "Hold on, just watch this"
I do all my hoes bold as fuck 'cause I'm not shit
But they'd never run away, I swear, they will not quit
Tryna come up off a nigga swag, man, that's not it
I keep the cough medicine around me, but I'm not sick
I'm in the snow droppin' plays off like I'm Saint Nick
Should I pop a RP or a V cut? I cannot pick
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
All that barkin', I could tell he not the top dog
One-sevens y'all be rollin', swear to God, them not logs
Know my shooter, he don't talk, he on the side like hot sauce
Cuddy gettin' rocks off, left titi with a locked jaw
Everyday I wake up and thank God I'm not y'all
Scared of dog, he the type to go and get the cops called
VVS's in the Carties left me with a snotball
It ain't a sushi bar when unky finna chop raw
Double cuppin', swervin' 'round behind the wheel like I'm an alcoholic
All that shit he sayin' 'bout the source, but that's just Malcolm talkin'
He just in the middle
Small-minded, I can't hang around, you thinkin' little
