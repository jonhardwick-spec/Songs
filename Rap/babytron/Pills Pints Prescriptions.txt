[Intro: Fordio]
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
Uh, shit
[Verse 1: Fordio]
I'ma pour the Stilpane, mix it with the Trish, uh
Really tryna kick it, this shit gettin’ attention
Wipin' down every week, got my palms itchin'
Juggs, they caught plenty, on the road, me and gang get serious
Why the hell they say they love but I’m feeling all the envy?
With the bullshit, can miss me, wipe a piece until it's empty
I ain't have drank in days, but I seen my archive, got me timid
My dog said, "I'm the one," why you takin' risks? Boy, you don't listen
[Verse 2: MJPAID]
Score a pint and rip the seal, when I go broke, I'm goin' missing
I’ve been peepin’ niggas talkin', we the ones who really live it
Don’t do shit else, I'ma get it
Niggas broke, ain't tryna fix it
On the road, ain't movin’ timid
But I'm still gon' do the limit
I'm in love with the money, I don't think this lil' bitch get me
Grab a pop, that bitch cream, score a pint and then I mix it
Way too geeked off of shrooms, bitch, I'm trippin' off this lippy
Rip the seal, then I lick it, I can't lie, bitch, I'm addicted
