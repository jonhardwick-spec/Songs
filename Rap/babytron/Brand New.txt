[Intro: StanWill]
(
Ooh, Sav killed it
)
Whew
Bitch, huh
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Got a brand-new chain, I'm a brand-new me
Steppin' on my opposites in some brand-new sneaks
All my bitches elegant, you cuffin' ran-through freaks
If you see me with your bitch, she gettin' slammed through sheets
My bitch tellin' me that she don't trust me, okay
Baddie tellin' me she tryna fuck me, okay
Keep the hit stick if doggy rush me, okay
Aimin' for his chicken nugget, if he duck, he okay
Whole gang on go, we ain't stoppin' soon
Your ho silly, tryna be my bride but I'm not a groom
Boy, this bitch'll sweep the streets but it's not a broom
Talkin' all that yadda-yadda, he got hit with bada boom
Bing bada baow, got that fucker tucked
Tell a ho to kiss my pendants, watch how quick she pucker up
Up a weapon on you, fuck an uppercut
Mr. Cut-Into-a-Ho, like, bitch, is you gon' fuck or what?
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Is you gon' suck or what?
TRX wrap brown, but the seats tan, this a peanut butter truck
We leavin' out of Hutch
You would think I made a sandwich, rollin' up grape jam and peanut butter Runtz
Brand-new house, brand-new wheels
Brand-new plug, so it's brand-new seals
Took my ho into Dior, she want brand-new heels
If you livin' how you say, tell me how brand new feels
Might as well'll shot the whole drum, I sent ninety-eight
Rappin' like a gangster, ended up on 1090 Jake
Why you hatin' on the team? Let mines be great
Shit, tour catchin' up tonight, set might be late
You a private, we some generals
When I smile, you see Amethyst diamonds and some emeralds
Richie cost a quarter ticket with no diamonds in the bezel
Y'all is not important, out here tryin' to be special
