[Intro]
(
I am the King
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Head mediocre
, treat a ten like a six
What y'all hoes want? Y'all smoke or want a fifth?
Ain't no night spending, use yo legs or call a Lyft
Double G in money on me, come and get a sniff
She know I'm finna kill it when I say I'm finna get behind
On a bad day, me and Tron'll still hit Revive
I'm just living life 'cause you know that you can't hit rewind
You can hit it too, ain't no need to call the pussy mine
Tron called the bank, told 'em that we coming with a load
Bitch, I'm made of steel, to my niggas, I can never fold
Niggas biting styles, stealing swag, kinda feel like
Soulja
How the fuck is you down to ride? You ain't never drove
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
How the fuck is you down to slide? Ain't never shot a gun
You only caught two or three jacks, that is not a run
Exotic puff make me go, I got toxic lungs
Looking like you far from a bag, better hop in one
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Where my lighter at? I ain't high enough
Where my writer at? I ain't swipe enough
No, you can't get higher, you don't drive enough
Finna punch some Forces, these ain't white enough
Sliding with a punch, fuck around and call me "Tronny Cage"
Iced up, high as hell, looking like I'm Johnny Dang
And I'm skating like I'm on a rink
And I'm skating like I'm on a rink, it's a hockey day
