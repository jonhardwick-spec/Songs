[Intro]
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Ten Dracs 'round, bitch, I'm ridin' 'round with toe-taggers
Got a white boy who pull up shootin' like he Mo Wagner
I'll probably piss you off, I ain't got no manners
Pushin' pros through, I'm on the Mac like an engineer
All I did was look into his eyes, I could sense the fear
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
I think my BBL senses tingling, I can sense the rear
I'm gettin' a handjob while I'm drivin', I can barely steer
VVS shawty, my nickname The Big Chandelier
I'm hearin' everything, I know what's up, I got Martin's ears
Baby got the cheeks hangin' loosly off the gauchos
I bought her new Chanel just for clеanin' up the household
Want a kid, now I play the family guy, I'm gеttin' old
Tricia Takanawa in a soda got me out cold
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Two chains got me freezin' like the South Pole
Ten grams in the 'Wood got the whole house blowed
Bitch askin' for some money, huh, how about no?
Run up on me lookin' crazy, then I'm whippin' out pole
