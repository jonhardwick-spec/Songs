[Intro]
Alright
Overthinking make my day worse
I can't help it, shit, I guess that's just the way my brain work
(
Hokatiwi
)
[Chorus]
Overthinking make my day worse
I can't help it, shit, I guess that's just the way my brain work
You can't see the logo, spent eight hunnid on a plain shirt
Need a plug on pharmaceuticals, like, where's a brave nurse?
It's a mental thing, grinding, I'm talking psychological
Hoodied up with Villain, shit finna get diabolical
Counting numbers up, like, how the fuck I fail algebra?
ARP, it got more legs on it than a tarantula
[Verse]
Global now, I caught a flight from Canada to Africa
Why you talking shit working at Wendy's? Tell that spatula
They won't see us coming down they block, tint at the maximum
Nineties vixen vibes, bitch walked in looking like Pamela
Apple Maps on her period, I had to backstreet it
Out the country sending shots, I guess I'm Van Fleet
You ain't got no brain capacity, thinking our stacks even (Brrt)
Fuck some Tiffany, I took my bitch to Van Cleef & Arpels
Sink made of marble, I just winked and she gargled
Twinkle, twinkle, little Cuban link, watch this bitch sparkle
Pop out, sleep him, last thing that he ever felt was startled
World tour vibes, we on the road, I feel like Day and them
Watch the villains win back-to-back, we just like Isaiah 'nemShit, we the Bad Boys
Shroom tripping, I done landed on the asteroid
Walk out, water dripping everywhere like Blastoise
Out in Sweden geeking up, like, where's the Sad Boys?
Jack Man but I be punching off the Androids
Catch a body boys, they put him on a tabloid
