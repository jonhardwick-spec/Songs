Stomp a nigga out in my Timbs, how this tree taste?
Hit Jay Ale's with a punch, this a free steak
Ringing down his block like a bell, he gon' meet Drac'
Ever since a youngin', always knew that I would be great
2018, was doing fillips at the speedway
Why would I work a J-O-B? I get free pape'
Fuck them lil' rumors, never listened to the "he say"
Difficult shots, Hall of Fame, I don't need space
Margielas like a pedicure, I got feet paint
Crazy how I seen my first band off of eBay
Turtle, damnTurtle Pie, this a three-five, I can't breathe straight
Re-rocked the ham six times, bitch, I'm Teejay
Bitch put two hands on it, I can't think straight
Bitch, I'm in my own lane, somеthing like I'm CJ
Woke up, made a quick band in my PJs
I ain't wanna hit, told hеr give me a quick BJ
Buffs on, bitch, I'm still eating like it's cheat day
Got three letters from yo bitch, a BJ
How the hell I wake up with cake? Who b-day?
Caught him on a plane and whooped his ass with my briefcase
Bitch playing games with the head like she EA
Bitch really bad but why the fuck her feet stank?
Talking 'bout the ShittyBoyz broke? I think he laced
Dee Star Treking off the 'Wood, he in deep space
Fire-ass methods in my phone, always need space
Fancy than a bitch, politicking over cheesecake
Hunnid hunnid dollar bills, can show you how the sleeve make
Pull up on a opp with some lead, get him erased
Shout-out Omarion, he probably somewhere down on PA
I'm with Suspect hitting gerbs down in CA
Had my head in the game before I heard of EA
Me and Dre dragging bags in Lennox down in GA
Four hunnid on my torso but my feet eight
I'ma probably really run it up until my feet break
Ten-five in the fonto, smoking three-eights
Run around the D with my stick like a relay
Really getting head while I was driving on the freeway
She left 'cause you couldn't buy a bag, you a cheapskate
Seen him in the field, he caught a bullet like he DK
