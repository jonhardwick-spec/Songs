[Intro]
Nyah
Ayy (Nyah)
[Verse]
Pull up and smoke your whole camp, Chino
These freak hoes ain't even drinkin' Don, they off Tito
Man, if I throw the ski on, it's a wrap like a burrito
Bitch cold like Alaska, but my face card on Reno
They say life a gamble, nowadays, my stash look like the 'nino
We've been headin' home for ten hours, last stop Telito
We was taught to keep it solid, why your mans drop a deeno?
Cartis whiter than a kilo, stand on business, no tuxedo
Boy, I'm blowin' big za, I'm BossMan, but I ain't Dlow
Put it in the pot and then I lock it up just like a PO
'Bow of Peeps smell like B.O, set it off, my bitch like Cleo
Talkin' chips with my guidos, not no Cheetos, not no Fritos
Be done spit all in your face if we ain't cool, I'm like Carlito
Got a bitch who likе bitches, come to think, she look likе Gio
Shit, I'm cut just like an emo, in your bushes incognito
Right, the Perc' turn me into Beno
Barely understand 'em, countin' pesos up with my amigos
Ese keep a dog, Chico, swing the stick, gray Bambino
Put your head down, ho, like I ain't ask if you a leo
They caught unky with a brick and took him down, I guess he Deebo
Hit the road and touched down, and thank God I'm trim Tebow
Dudey lost in the sauce
Dudey lost in the sauce, they can't find him like Nemo
I've been ballin' countless summers, got me feelin' like Rino
Doggy fucked the outfit up when he put on the Valentino
Man, and had the nerve to try and play it with Moschino
You so out the loop, it ain't no way you understand the lingo
Scratched five off the list back to back, that's a bingo
Hit a dreadhead up top, he lookin' like he went through chemo
Why he ridin' in an '03 still? Man, he ain't Greedo
Shotta fucked up in the head, he just want blood like a mosquito
All I see is digits, living life the Matrix, shit, I'm Neo
On the 7 off a seven, super throwed, just me and Pico
We'll pull up with six hundred shots, you'd think I came with Meemo
Six of Trissy in my soda, I ain't drinkin' no mojito
We ain't finna wrestle, do I look like Bruno Sammartino?
Gold, white gold, rose gold, that's a trio
Shit, I'm finna pop it, lookin' for a ho to match my ego
Told her turn around and toot it, watch how quick she hit a C-note
Couldn't keep up with his car, now heard he got his Chally repo'ed
I'ma go out like I'm Money Mitch before I be a Rico
Shit, the city GTA, completin' missions like I'm Niko
Tron for president, when I'm elected, bullshit gettin' vetoed
Seven years ago today, was slidin' dumps in Home Depot
Things changed, I could wake up, catch a jet to Puerto Rico (Nyoom)
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
