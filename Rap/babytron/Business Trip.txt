[Intro: Tay B]
Hmm, yeah
All facts, lil' nigga, hmm
Can't be fucked with, you feel me?
[Verse 1: Tay B]
I ain't havin' fun in LA, this a business trip
Drop on an opp, I hit his block and start sendin' shit
Fuck the cops, I'm only worried 'bout the witnesses
I can't hang around no nigga who don't benefit
Lil' nigga, this a Bentley truck, it's not a Genesis
Lil' cuz in the feds got caught with a switch and shit
Same niggas hatin', same hoes, you ain't missin' shit
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Thirty shows in forty days, then back to Michigan
It was local, now it's global, shit, I'm booked in Switzerland
The move I hit that lil' bitch with, it's meant for finishin'
You would think that cuddy starvin', askin' where the kitchen is
What the fuck's an L? You either get a win or learn a lesson
This a hybrid, when it get to E, just watch it turn electric
Thinkin' hoеs deserve it, your namе Deacon Ham from servin' blessings
Wocky in the Bimmer, am I German? Hit the curb and wreck it
[Verse 3: Tay B]
Mansion party, we got fifty bitches, it's just me and Tron
You think I'm only gettin' money, you should see the guys
Tell a freak ho come eat this dick, I don't wine and dine
Your mans died, you hit his bitch, boy, you outta line
You gon' let me fuck or naw? I'm Tay Dollar Signs
You got a handful of pennies, still'll drop a dime
If it ain't 'bout M's, my name won't go up on no dotted line
Before you get some bumps up on your tongue, you better stop the lyin'
