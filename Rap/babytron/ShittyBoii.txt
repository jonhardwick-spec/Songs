[Intro]
(
Ayy, Melly, what the fuck is that?
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Three of Quagy-agy, shit, I'm finna doze off
Heard you out here workin’, takin' orders, you ain't no boss
Switch the formula, but I can get it off the old sauce
Halftime on TNT, boy, I’ll let the pros talk
Drove off, V12
Boy, I'm strapped in the car without a seatbelt
Mr. Put That Shit up on His Body, check the details
Twenty-five at Hutchy, shit, I think that I could freeze Hell
Tax doggy, he could never get it for the retail
Doggy bone a burger, throw him on the grill
Handy Mandy, brodie spinnin' with it, all he know is drill
Bitch want some money, she off blow and pills
Jumped in the deep and I'm swimmin' in thе ocean still
Stick on me, feel like Harry Pottеr
Two baggies for the eighthies, in here blowin' Cherry Popper
Bankroll on Papa Smurf, the Christian Loubs on Larry Lobster
Dog Shit Militia, we got every Glock and every chopper
[Verse 2: DaBoii]
And every Glock and every chopper cook a nigga, Betty Crocker
Me and Tron Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne, we steady mobbin'
You send opps DMs, bitch, we send niggas to the doctor
I told baby, "Won't you come my way?" I Fetty Wap’ed her
I ain’t fuckin' with no whores and I ain’t fuckin' with no boppers
I ain't doin' songs with niggas out here fuckin’ with the oppers
Hit a nigga with that— fah, fah, fah, bet he holler
I told bro to give that lil' nigga a pass, bet he pop him
Lil' nigga threw dirt on my gang, bet we mop him
Told the bitch, "When I step in the scene, better acknowledge"
You want the Drac', baby A, or the Glock? Any option
Bitch, your brother just died, what you mean you ain't 'bout it?
You ain't slide for your mans, you just singin' about it
Yeah, they talk about that shit, but not bein' about it
Talk to God every day, but I don't read none of the Bible
I'm a grown-ass man with some lean in my bottle
On the gang
