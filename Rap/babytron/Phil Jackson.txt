Enrgy made this one
Alright, look
[Verse 1: Tae Retro &
BabyTron
]
When it comes to spice talkin', I’m very fluent
Ain't no middle ground for them boys, we are not congruent
Me and you are not the same, there is no confusion
I can put your girl onto game, she my favorite student
Niggas out here cappin' on they flags like Domination
I could show you how to get the bag with no hesitation
Seen me once, said I was the G.O.A.T., great observation
Whole gang perfect, never miss, we got great spacin’
I done set the trend for all these niggas, need recognition
I done set the wave, I'm on track like expedition
I'm the leading scorer of the league, no competition
Nowadays, I'm good with the numbers like long division
And I'm posted with the same guys
Niggas cappin', really out here livin' same lies
He tried to slide, he didn't think, they some brave guys
I’m tryna get it, I don’t care if we on the same time, never let 'em waste mines
I could put up numbers and drop, but I’d rather assist
You could check my field goal stats, I ain't planning to miss
All black Tech, got 'em thinkin' that Retro a Sith
In the rap game, he burnt out, so he needin’ a hit
Phil Jackson, when I'm in that— (Alright, hold on bro)
Phil Jackson, when I'm in that mode, I be coachin' the game
World champ, when it comes to rap, I had multiple reigns
I can snap whenever in the booth, I ain't lyrically sane
(
Fuck
