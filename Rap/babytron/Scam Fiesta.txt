[Verse 1: TrDee]
I ain't win the finals but I'm in a room full of winners
On riding waves, really think yo team is full of swimmers
I'll cuff a bitch when that nigga KD get the spinners
Seen his lil' roll, boy, we know he spent that on a dinner
Bro don't ever miss, I think it's steady shooter Hall of Fame
See a opp and we gon' turn 300, we gon' let it bang
Shout-out to the bitch that fucked the gang, I won't say yo name
Reaching for the strap, I think the opps is in the other lane
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Telegraming, getting active via cryptocurrency
Connection out in Europe, I been shipping shit to Germany
ShittyBoyz BabyTron, I know this lil' bitch heard of me
Surf and turf, heard you eating chicken strips at Burger King
Have my shooter turn his bully on, he a combo guard
Have my shooter turn his fully on, he'll stop yo heart
That secondhand punch line you using, that is not yo bar
I just want some throat, maybe pussy, nah, not yo heart
[Verse 3: TrDee]
I'm not Kevin, why you mention love? I don't affiliate
I'm not famous but I bet they know me, probably in yo state
I done fed niggas, now they probably looking at my plate
Pick up at eleven, bitch, you bet not be a minute late
Bitch exotic, weed exotic, live the Tiger King life
Baby caught me cheating, I'm like, "It ain't what it seem like"
Niggas all on go, I think I'm living with a green light
Whoa, my bitch like Vicky 'cause she rude and really mean, right?
