[Verse 1: Big Money Rich]
Two Perc' 10s make her bend over
Bands make these hoes wanna bring they best friend over
Found another glitch then I ran off with it
Caught another blitz but kept my hand off it
I'ma call you right back, I got a ounce to bake
Ayy, nigga, turn that shit down, I can't concentrate
I inherited a block that move ounces daily
I had a five year run before the cops ever ate me
Yeah, spectacular
Bitches wanna bite down on mе like they Dracula
After I hit hеr one time, I give her back to ya
Please keep that bitch on a leash, I'm damn near begging ya
My mans down the way, he damn near made the news
No [?] he down there making food
