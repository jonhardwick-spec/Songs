[Intro: BabyTron]
(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
Booted, I'm booted, I'm booted
Booted, I'm booted (
Meech
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Booted up off three tens, this bitch said that I'm actin' lazy
Havin' DSM as underdogs, I bet that bracket breaks
My only hobby stackin' pape'
Shooter into tappin' tops, robber into crackin' safes (Ayy)
We the turkey bag terrorists, y'all matchin' eighths
Bein' broke an illness, dude and them, they need to vaccinate (Ayy)
Back against the ropes, I'm turnin' into Cassius Clay
Back against the ropes, I bet I leave him on a stack of hay (Knock out)
[Verse 2: Talibando]
Washin' dope money, tryna turn it clean
Kill your coupe, now you ain't got no friends like [?]
Trappin' off of two phones, Cuban link two-tone
Navy Wavy Army stick together like a group home
Presidential Rolex, what that mean? More sex
I'll turn the back of the Benz to the porn set
I'll send a bag to your crib, check your doorsteps
Nigga tried to stunt with 10K, that's a poor flex (Bum)
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
It's time for you to find a source, neph
We ain't tradin' Glocks, the fuck you thought this was, Forex? (Ham)
Time to grab the bill like they ain't do they chores yet
At McNamara fly as hell, but I ain't board yet (Yoom)
I got a four poured up, but I ain't snore yet
Left it on her forehead, she got a sore neck
OT ballin', travellin', you'd think I took my fourth step
Overdid the shroomies, think I'm floatin' through a vortex
