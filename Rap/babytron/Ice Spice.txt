[Verse]
Yeah, you get a couple tokens for the body, hit the head, shit, that's a bonus
Catching bricks like Valančiūnas, clerk remember me as Jonas
Tryna catch my focus, mixing potions, shit like
Hocus Pocus
Blowing out some Periwinkle smoke, you'd think I rolled a lotus
East to West, we scoring on that road, might catch us coast-to-coasting
Shit, I'm talking bogus, never could I cuff, you hoes atrocious
Cuddy dropped a fifty on they block, that's a career-high
Tolerance ridiculous, dropped a five and they near-high
Eyes wide open, I ain't nod yet
Seven bitches in the room, they finna have a contest
Like who can make my knees lock?
I been on the Quagen diet, think I need to detox, think I need a clean pop
More 'bows than a cabinet, this is not the weed spot
Off the shrooms out in Pacifica, I'm with the Tree Tops
Reach for my jewels? I'm on his head like a
yamaka
I be with the terrorists, he play, might send a bomb at him
You don't got a dollar took, never send a shot at us
Why the opps playing enough pape' to get they mamas fucked?
Y'all could step into a sauna, still wouldn't be hot as us
Yamamotos like a calzone, shit, the pockets stuffed
Experimented with the pop, now it's a test subject
Made your BM walk the interstate, ain't get the neck up yet
Underwater, I can see clear, I don't use goggles
Trif'-ass boy been eating runners since the blue waffles
Foreigns with the fur, I'm in the UFO like Chewbacca
Brain-damaged, hit an opp up top, he can't chew pasta
Had a petty-ass Sprite, now it's thick as Ice Spice
When it's time to gamble up in life, can't roll the dice twice
If the price right, hop up on a same-night flight
Doggy finished, PVP his life highlight
Finna pull my hair out, this worker fucked the load up
I can fuck the stove up but I be punching phones up
Tried to touch the M off scams but the rap responsible
Shit, I'm tryna make it to the top past the obstacles
Stay away from these lil' sluts, they just be problematic
Two-Face, Two-Face, doggy got some Gotham tactics
Pulled up on the plug, was looking like we shopped at NASA
If it really get like that, I'll pay it to my top assassin
Fuck DND, phone on airplane mode
Five chains on my neck but I'll wear eight more
I been jumping shitty since the Fairlane days
