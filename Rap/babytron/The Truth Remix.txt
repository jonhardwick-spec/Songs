[Verse]
Habibi firebombing, got a missile tucked
If them robbers come through then I guarantee they give it up
Lifestyle huge, this basic bitch, she into little stuff
Hit a bucket, shit, I'm getting clutch
Unky spot a fiend, whip it up and then he fix her up
You ain't got the heart, go 'head, pull the trigger, punk
Dog Shit Militia, ShittyBoyz, it ain't no switching up
Appetizer hit for five hunnid, I'm just getting lunch
If I see an opp, he getting punched or he getting stumped
Matter fact, scratch that, he gon' get a slug
Walked up into Hutch and spent four on some tinted buffs
I'm sick the runner hoes out here getting cuffed
Ran it up so long, I looked down and the kicks was scuffed
Really up, blicky tucked, this bitch got a fifty drum
Came a long way, I used to walk around with fifty bucks
Came a long way, I'm reminiscing 'bout them giffy runs
Came a long way, it's kinda funny now they hit me up
Came a long way from high school, was fucking Ypsi up
Came a long way from that first vid' that fucked the city up
No cap, no hat, blow first, don't blow back
Quagen in my pop, unc' and them, they used to pour Act'
We'll jack 'em like a Pro Max
Only zaza, no Reggie Miller when I blow thrax
Let me hear it's up, it's where the floor at
Got a new Gen but I'ma kill you with the old strap
