[Intro]
(
It's Bluestrip, baby
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
You won't get my heart because I'm married to the money
Being broke a joke but I could never find it funny
Playing in the rain, I had to wait till it was sunny
Niggas used to doubt us, they ain't see the storm coming
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Ain't a better lesson in this life shit than going broke
She gon' use her throat like a pro 'cause she know I'm GOAT
If the three-five don't kill the pain, I'ma pour a four
Thousand dollar belt, I sag the 'Miris 'cause it's 'posed to show
[Verse 3: TrDee]
They gon' try to come and ride yo wave when you 'bout to blow
All you gotta do is say it's up then it's on the floor
Had my heart broke then I vowed to never love a ho
Piece still hitting, fuck it, Tron, let's hit another store
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Sorry not sorry, I'ma ball until I'm flatlining
Fourth quarter straight with it, I don't do the halftime
Did the dash and woke the neighbors up, they hear the Scats flying
White boy'll throw a bullet at you like I'm Matt Ryan
