[Intro]
Whew, whew, whew
No cap, I was watchin' everybody ballin'
No cap, I was watchin' everybody ballin'
No cap, I was watchin' everybody ballin'
Helluva made this beat, baby
ShittyBoyz
[Chorus]
No cap, I was watchin' everybody ballin'Now I'm on the court ballin', droppin' everybody's jaws
(Whew)
Phone smack, when you up, everybody call
Heart cold now, but that's just everybody fault (On God)
I used to watch 'em ball from the top row
Now I'm on the court scorin' shit, I do not choke (Ballin')
Runtz got me high flyin', top rope
Punch shit like UFC, call me Tron Jones
(Punch)
[Verse 1]
On God, I can make ten easily (On God)
Burnin' rubber in the street like it's Need for Speed
Bitch on fire with the work like Alicia Keys
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Find a lil' sample, then I have Helly freak the beat (What up, Helly?)
If you haven't found out, bitch, I'm one of one
Up strap but got beat, is you tough or what?
Quit the game, doggie, bone, you can't fuck with us
If it's money money in the air, Zion, I'm jumpin' up
Haha, nah, for real, get your bunnies up (Haha)
Finna pass bro the sticks, I got twenty-one (Here you go)
Turn your voice the fuck down and get your money up
Feel like Little Debby, got a pocket full of honey buns (Honey buns)
Lil' bitch, I was made to win (Bitch)
Tried to lock me out the game, but I'm breakin' in
My white boy scammin' shit, better change your PIN
I'm the punch god, grab a piece, then I say, "Amen" (Ooh)
