[Verse 1: TrDee]
Stan brought a freak through, I told him tag me in
Told God I'm really sorry, all I do is sin
Tron really bucked the fuck up and then hit the gym
I be hanging with some real ballers that'll break the rim
I ain't danced in a minute, chain be getting sturdy
Told my mama, "We gon' be straight, please don't even worry"
How ironic, got a .30 on me while I'm eating curry
I'ma make a mil' before I even make it close to thirty
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Pull up drop a hunnid, boy, you need to turn yo hustle up
In the fast lane, swerving off a purple double cup
Gas pressing in that spaceship, thеy heard me hover up
Why you cuff that bitch? Shе the type to burn the rubber up
Hunnid shots, fifty shots, bitch, we war ready
Hunnid dollar meal, it's some Wock', left the floor messy
They tried to lock us out the game like the door heavy
This a Hellkitty, sick y'all boys tryna floor Hemis
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Hate my generation, think you broke if you ain't got designer
Bitch put her titties in my face and then she told me sign her
Took his lil' bitch for the night and he couldn't find her
Pockets really stuffed with some paper, I feel like a binder
Seen this shit coming, feel like Raven
Uncle's in the field like he was slaving
I could really call a plan with you, Nick Saban
Nonfiction when rap, ain't no faking
