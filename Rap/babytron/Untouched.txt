[Intro]
Yeah, got a bad bitch with me, she won't step out 'less her
It's a thousand ways to get pape and you don't even know one (
No way, Hozay
)
Huh, yeah
[Verse]
It's a thousand ways to get pape and you don't even know one
Bad bitch won't step out the crib 'less her toes done
You ask why I pay eighty for it, you should smoke some
Don't even ask about the cup if you ain't pour one
Dee got a pack of flipped Visas, finna road run
Don't ask for a slug if I ain't never hold one
Yo boyfriend a bitch, he the one who do the store run
I ain't used to play, now I'm balling like thе coach son
I ain't used to care, nah, I'm playing, still don't give a fuck
It's ninеty-five, still throw the BAPE on and zip it up
Only 'cause I seen a opp out, I'm finna blick him up
She cheated 'cause you bought a little bag, you ain't trick enough
You are not a killer, can you stop the mean-mugging?
I knew since day one I'd be something
Where the fuck the takeover badge? The whole team hustling
Ain't shit change, twenty shoes off of three punches
​iPhones, gift cards, that's the shit that make me smile
Had to meet 'round for that one shit on
8 and Wyo
'
Don't stop on yo dreams, lil' dawg, it might take a while
If they flick me with this ID, I'ma say I'm Kyle
When I put you in a body bag, it ain't no posterizer
All it take is a head nod, bet my soldier fire
Bet the engineer head nod 'cause he know it's fire
That Tron jersey gon' be in the rafters when the GOAT retire
Shoot the bag down, Van Dyke, down to Romeo
Just 'cause we had class together, you don't know me, bro
Talking 'bout her head good, shit, can you show me though?
Ain't never put you on no cheese, what are yo' homies for?
You better think about it
Yeah, that tough talking all cool, you better be about it
Up a buck on a bitch, shit, I think I'm Giannis
Buck shot
to his back, shit, man, I think I got him
But you get beat if we box like I'm SpotEmGottem
Bae said she want a new fit, shit, that's not a problem
You can't run, you can hide
, boy, you can't stop them shottas
I be with them sharks, lil' bro and them the top piranhas
Make a thirty ball, put a dub up
All them death threats but I'm untouched
If we fam, then we locked in, yeah, the love stuck
All hustle, all leg work, boy, it's fuck luck
Piss me off? You gon' have to try to dodge a
M-80
Spun her three nights back to back, she did the 1080
Happy that we linked the fourth time 'cause her head crazy
Something like a baker in this bitch, I make bread daily
Fourth quarter, that's when the real players show out
Moncler, Goose, or the Knuckle when it's snow out
Fell in love with fast money, sick you took the slow route
Might've told her "yes" back then but it's "no" now
