[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy
What up, Stan? What up, Dee?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Wasn't even hungry but I paid three for lunch
My nigga Tron fucking hoes off the Bieber cut
If I ain't got it on me, I know Dee'll bust
Still kicking hoes out, throw me a FIFA cup
Hoodie Vlone, steak T-bone
Rottweiler tee, I should throw a leash on
I'm with them, boy, don't get beat on
Went one up on Kevin Gates, I punch three phones
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
"Tron, do you give a fuck?", fuck no
Wake up in the morning, throw my thrust on
Off-White, Virgil kicks, bitch like, "What's those?"
If that lil' ship sink, she gon' jump boats
Ha-ha, I'll throw her in a blender
Making plays, I'm the type to throw her to the center
This is not reggie bush, boy, I'm smoking pressure
Looking in the mirror, "Tron, you're the GOAT, remember?"
[Verse 3: TrDee]
You should know why yo bitch back hurting
Showed him my method, now bro done working
Yeah, I'm up now to my old hoes lurking
[?] Stan, like, sir, why you smirking?
Huh, 'cause I'm AP
I still sit and wonder why these niggas hate me
Hmm, 'cause they ain't me
Or they main bitch a lil' ho that wanna neck me
