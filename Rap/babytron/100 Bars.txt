[Part I]
[Intro]Bitch, yeah, let me count for y'all
[Verse]
One of one, it ain't no duplication of my DNA
Two hoes, one a scammer, other one a CNA
Three, two, one, shit, I'm finna give a PSA
Four bullets holes into your cape, I catch you bein' brave
Five seconds left up on the clock, I'm hittin' buzzer beaters
Six bars for twenty-K, I just knocked out another feature
Seven seas how I'm drippin', I create sauce
Tell the opps, I'm last one in the hole just like a 8-ball
9-1-1, call them bastards, firе in the booth
Ten out of ten timеs, can tell a liar from the truth
It's eleven-eleven, you better make a wish
At eleven, I turn thirteen like twelve ain't exist
Catch me hoppin' out your bushes, it's Friday the 13th (We'll turn your block to Crystal Lake)
Fourteen grams, use my wrist and turn it to a zip
Cuddy just made fifteen in a day, he servin' in the sticks
Sweet sixteen of the Wocky, I'ma break the bracket
The Glocky hold a seventeen today, I played it standard (I ain't wanna stick out in public)
If the eighteen-wheeler make it back, just know
I'm rubber band man, just like David Banner
I was nineteen with a plan, but they ain't understand
20/20 vision off the shrooms, I'm in Wonderland
Lil' brodie steady clutchin', he a savage, 21
Twenty-two, I tote the deuce, deuce, this bitch a tummy tuck
Twenty-three, it gotta be my jersey number, bitch, I'm G.O.A.T
Twenty-four, I ball like Kobe, in the clutch, bitch, it's the up
Twenty-fifth of December, that's the type of gift that I am
Twenty-six different ways to do fraud, must forget that I scam
Scrumble touch down with twenty-seven like he Eddie George
Actin' like he sellin' twenty-eights, how much you bet he poor?
On the twenty-ninth, he gettin' fired because dawg a temp
Hustle that's instilled in me, could score a thirty off the bench
Thirty-one, he rollin' Reggie, sippin' Miller Lite
Opps say they got thirty, I tote thirty-two 'cause it's on sight
Thirty-three, I pour a three then double back, I'm finna fly
Thirty-four people in front of you, you gotta sit in line
Thirty-five, rollin' up Durantulas, these three fives
Why your wrist on thirty-six? You know you lookin' weak, guy
It's thirty-seven different reasons I can't stop hustlin'
Up the .38 and hit his top, hell nah, we not tustlin'
Why you tryna beef with me, like ain't you thirty-nine?
Shooter got .40 with a mop for all you dirty guys
Forty-one, I'm fadin' off the drugs, I'm finna do the dirt
My Audemar a forty-two, like all I had to do was work
Forty-three days without drank, the monkey grabbin' on my shirt
Forty-four outside, but bitch, I'm sweatin', active off a Perc'
Forty-five plus fifty-five, that's me, like add me up, you nerd
Paid Habibi forty-six, don't even ask me why he purged
They think I play with trick dice, I rolled like forty sevens
First forty-eight, you a snitch
Forty-nine times out of fifty, I think you would switch
Fifty rackies if you never seen that lil' boy, you a shrimp
