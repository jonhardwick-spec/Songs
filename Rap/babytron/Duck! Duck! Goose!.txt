[Intro]
(
I got so much Enrgy
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Shit, fuck, damn, her head incredible
I got my Glocky too, I'm not scared of you
Man, that ain’t no Wocky, might be Theraflu
Don't even try to flex on me, 'cause I’ll embarrass you
Face down, her ass in the air just like an airplane
She be always talkin' 'bout her ex, that nigga so lame
Pull up on a nigga with some sticks, this ain't no game
Need a new team 'cause your shooters ain't got no aim
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Crackheads get a scuff, they get threw away
Put a cannon to my opps like an Q&A
I'm with gang, finna oop a play
Twenty on me, thirty in the Glock, off a deuce of drank
Told you that the sky was the limit, I'm in spacе with it
Bitch think I’m an alien, I’m in my city spaceshippin'
Glock’ll burn an oppy if I spray it, ain't no Mace in it
Brodiе in his zone, he smokin' 'Scotti, but it ain’t Pippen
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
He can't guard me one-on-one, buddy need help
Remember ridin' '87, this a V12
Doggy crashed out, I hope he wore a seatbelt
Put that burner all up to his grill and watch his teeth melt
Triple-double, triple-double, shit, I feel like Oscar Rob'
Sprayin' what I'm playin', at the 'nino off the baccarat
If he ain't talkin' 'bout no money, I hear dot-dot-dot
Check the score, the time is gettin' low, you better watch the clock
