[Verse 1: Project Money and
BabyTron
]
Like, is you serious?
And send the work to Georgia, have 'em curious
My life need a dozen movies, Fast & Furious
Here comes the thirteenth one, this bitch ain't have her period
Fourteen shots have 'em delirious
We'll catch a body, then go take a Lake Erie trip
Your bitch keep blowin' up my phone, she on some eerie shit
On the road, this a me, myself, I, and Siri trip
Smokin' zaza out of Cali, this ain't no Larry zip
Blingin' in some Hutchy ice, this ain't no Gary kit
Have your ho trick over them treats, you on some scary shit
I think this bitch starin' 'cause I'm very rich
Hell yeah, you lift your wrist once, she on some glary shit
Think your bitch tryna fuck, she tryna braid my hair to twist
She gon' lick my clean balls, I ain't got no hairy dick
Life crazy, shit, I'm in the ring with a married bitch
I'd probably put a baby in a ho, but I ain't gon' marry the bitch
Twenty different flavor foreigns, I be on various shit
Hit the work twenty times, I got various mix
Cuddy got a fake D, the clerk think he Darius Finch
[Verse 2: Project Money]
She'll never know my government, take the ball and I'm runnin' it
Do your backyard like a Theta and I'm stompin' it
I'll put a ten on a one, they say I'm jumpin' it
Slide some shit across your forehead when I'm thumpin' it
