[Verse 1]
New Balenciagas, they was twelve hundred
She is not a slumper, slut your bitch, she just a damn runner
Fucked a ho without a rubber, she was too bad
Heard you pawned your kit for five racks, niggas goin' out sad
I'm World Tour forever, all these racks got me shitty, boy
Real mafia member, what you know about Frank Nitti, boy?
Duffel bag, boy, I get the money like I'm Tity Boi
What you know about turn ins? Hit the coney, niggas servin'
[?] callin' tryna give me that pussy, say it's urgent
If my niggas stretched the work, it's like he ran up out detergеnt
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
This bitch tryna get iced out, but she ain't worthy of it
Brodiе buttoned up from down the street, he hittin' Curry buckets
Check my jack, I made a thirty-somethin'
Wake up, hop up in the shower, first thing after, dirty cup it
Tints for lightweights, this a thirty function
They ain't surprised my trigger finger itchin', off the Perky clutchin'
Get some head, then block the ho, we ain't even catch a vibe
If I send the drop, won't nothin' happen, you can't catch a ride
Before I go to sleep, I thank God that he blessed the guys
Audemars too blurry, turn my phone on just to check the time
[Verse 3]
This that mob ties type of shit'll get a nigga hog tied
Play with any nigga on a song, we make mamas cry
I popped a Xan and walked to Saint Laurant, I don't know what I got
I switch numbers every couple months, she thought she was blocked
I got more Ricky than Doughboy brother
I hit they cousin, I ain't know they even knew each other
I need to take it out in blue hundred
Get head in the coupe, it's lovely
Money talks, you like Chris Tucker
Stay quiet and bought some dunkin'
Throw money and leave the function
