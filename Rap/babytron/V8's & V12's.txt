I hear you, JAY C

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Think I need to go and see a reverend, I been fighting demons
Paranoid self-scanning, I got used to swiping pieces
Living in the blender finished, she gon' live her life defeated
Wax pen, dirty pop, I'm just shopping high in Neiman's
V8s and V10s, you can catch me flying speeding
I can't switch teams, you would probably go and sign a season (Pow-pow-pow)
Pop out with ARP and send him right to Jesus
I ain't leaving, I ain't leaving till that bag come (Phew)
Stop flashing ten, that's a daily jack run (Phew)
Bandicooting of the Quagy-agy, I might crash some (Shit)
Colossal 'Wood, half Cookie and it's half Runtz
Shit, I got some black lungs
[Verse 2: TrDee]
We gon' do him like he Kunta if he running off
Hit him in his foot, I tried to knock his shouldеr off (Damn)
Getting to that type of levеl, I can't hit it raw
I ain't finna play no games with you, this is not the Saw
Keep coughing 'cause the 'Wood full of opposition
Cut the bitch off 'cause she don't never listen
I'll air this bitch out if I feel a tension
I been balling in the D, I could've been a Piston
Fuck the past, fuck a "would've", "could've", "should've"
I'm a ShittyBoy 'cause I been shitting since the pull-ups
Made a couple Pros off the phones, I got the hookup
If rapping had a draft class, niggas should've took us (Phew)
