We never lacking, we ride with them sticks that go bing-bada bing-bada bing-bada boom
He got it, she got it, they got it, we killing everybody, yeah, who walk in this room
Ride with my dog, like Scooby Do (skrt)
She off the molly, she know what to do
I'm from Chicago, yeah I'm from the zoo (for real)
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
The choppa, it gotta beam
My shooter, bada-bing bada-bing bada-bing boom
Scoring some wocky, then drop a three, drop a three, drop a three, shit it ain't even turn noon
Hop in the foreign, gotta speed, gotta zoom
Actin' like you rob shit, not a thief, not a goon
Bada-bing, bada-boom, Bada-bing, bada-boom, pull—
