[Intro]
Marc Boomin, this you?
[Verse 1: Kasher Quon]
Hot as hell in the whip, riding with three pistols
I just blew a nigga crib up with three missiles
Riding in a Scat Pack, look like a green pickle
I drink red, lame niggas sip green liquor
I just rode through yo hood and you wasn't in it
I can't meet you for the sauce, you gotta come get it
This a baby Draco with a drum in it
Hit her from the back, she keep saying, "Put yo thumb in it"
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Talking 'bout fighting, do I look like Triple H?
I'ma let this Glock punch you like a middleweight
Been on the road for two days and I'm still awake
I ain't hopping out my bag 'less I'm hopping in some pape
Feel like Tim Duncan, I been scoring in the bank
I ain't a shrimp but it's sitting on my dinner plate
Time is money, I refuse to be a minute late
Quon pulled up with a .40 looking for some pistol play
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Got a piece for every puzzle but you hoes still a mystery
Left my old bitch in the past, history
I done jugged another granny off the trickery
Real slimeball, pray that God don't see the sin in me
I don't know what you thought but it's not this
My shooter wear glasses, dawg, he will not miss
He couldn't start out wide receiver, how he drop shit
Swear to God I love Chase, I just pop six
