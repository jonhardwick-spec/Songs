All the food in the spot, we done turned it to a banquet
Money, money, dollar, dollar, skrill, that's my language
Saucin' in Saucony, I might switch up to the Asics

G's in my pocket, I ain't no Freemason
Snow bunny hunter, fuck around and be a racist

I can't fuck with him, he givin' information to the agents (Ooh)

[Verse 4: Certified Trapper &
BabyTron

Slide down his block, fap, hit him, then vacation (
Pop, pop-pop

Sesame chicken got me tryna fuck that Asian (
Ooh

Third 'Wood with your bitch, she a Blasian (
Whew

[Verse 5: BabyTron]
Coupe from outer space, you'd think that we invading
Whole gang gettin' pape', this shit must be contagious
We the favorites when y'all go and place some bets in Vegas
