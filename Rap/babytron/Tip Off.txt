[Verse 1: TrDdee]
When the tipoff? I been waitin' just to ball
I ain’t telling you shit, just give me my call
Sick I have to cut you off, I thought you was my dog
Fuck I look like chasin' hoes? Man, I don't even dog
I can’t leave the crib without my Glocky, it's a part of me
If I miss your ass, you really lucky, play the lottery
Wanna be like me, I'm disrespected by you mockin' me
Always jumpin' Shitty 'cause I know my haters watchin' me
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Jeans by Amiri, hoodie Gallery (Yeah)
Your bitch say she love me, oh, that's flattering (Aw)
Need a check, you want me at your gathering
I’m at Action Impact for attachments, told ’em, "Ladder me" (Brrt)
Bro like shootin' rappers, think he Cole Bennett (Baow)
He thought she was loyal, but these hoes wicked (Nah)
AR got a scope, could pop him long distance
I don’t want that lil' neck if it don't leave my toes twitching (Phew)
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Phew, brrt, yeah
LAX to ATL and then I'm back to the D
Catchin’ Z's off the red, sippin' Act' in my sleep
It's a dream, it's a dream, it's a dream
Why I try to fit a hundred in my jeans? Ripped the seams
Chula, flip phone beatin', I ain't seen 'em, it's a fiend
Had my dick down her throat, why you think that bitch a queen?
Forty got a double cup, stand and sleep, Mr. Bean
Life a movie, but I'm here, shit, I wouldn't switch a scene
