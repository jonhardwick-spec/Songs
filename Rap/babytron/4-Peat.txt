Three fits, seven hunnid, bitch, these some Yeezy steps
He ain't got no blick, full court, that's a easy press
Squared up with Tron, hit his ass with a sneaky leftRan it up for 'bout a week, I done got sleep depressed
Glock a motherfucker, hitting everything the beam detectLouis V runners on, I done turned my feet to chess
Punch God, Jack Man, bitch, I'm a Visa vet
Riding 'round looking rough as hell like you DMX
We gon' leave the opposition bleeding like they PMSIf you pull up perky, end up lеaving in a EMS
Lied to the bitch, told her that I only chеat on testsLil' slut said I need a heart, bitch, I need yo neck
High as hell with the gang, ain't no pizza left
I done caught up to them bitches, I been dreaming less
I done got tired of the hoes, I been fiending lessWhen all you see is the money, you don't see no rest
I could up some big-ass racks, you ain't see no breastsBoy, you ain't a 'rilla, couple .223s beat yo chest
Hutch lost his motherfucking mind, don't you see my neck?
Really got the green out the mud, bitch, I think I'm Shrek
Bitch told me that I'm not shit, what did you expect?Feeling like a chill day, think I wanna do the tech
Head so good, lil' bitch got her cheeks caressedI'll tell my niggas mask up, bitch, I think I'm Gretch
Been did the radio, we might be on TV next
On a jack trip, card play for the GPS
Choppa fold 'em like a 3DSShe a lil' headhunter, you ain't even see the mess
Punching all month off a piece, made the CC stretch[?] off PUA, now he think he fresh
Money gram, 2016, stayed at CVS
[?] got the Purple jeans on, my habibi wet
Diamonds look like lemonade, Wocky in the Minute MaidAll I wanted was the money, I ain't never want the fame
Hitting bitches off the thrust, I ain't in the spitting gameBro clutching, he gon' shoot like he tryna win the game
Bitch, I'm big tripping, change gears when I'm switching lanes
Spin his block in the wintertime, that's a figure eight
When you feed niggas, they gon' ask you for a bigger plateIf you ask me, we the coldest group in the state
