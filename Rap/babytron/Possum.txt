Long live $cam, hey
[Verse: BabyTron &
Icewear Vezzo
]
Sold-out tour, merch out of stock
Cuddy scored a brain shot, knocked the nerve out his top
Bought a thousand pints, spent the word on the wopObituary for the opps 'cause they gettin' murdered a lot
It's been a long-ass time, I'm talkin' Nerfs since he shot
I poured a whole sixteen, that's a verse in the pop
Could've fucked for the free, spent a verse on the twatStash spots in the Urus, 'cause they search for the Glock
Putting cuffs on these hoes, y'all boys worsе than the cops
Cuddy really fightin' demons, hе in church with the chop
[Verse 2: Icewear Vezzo]
These niggas hurtin' for clout, ain't no work in they spot
Thirty pointers in the top, it look like Percs in the watch
Stack of Forgis on the feat', pull up Bentley on the 6
Richard Mille on my wrist, leave her skizzy for the fent
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Shit, I'm dizzy flippin' 'scripts, I got a sixty in the clip
We gettin' litty in the whip, she put a hickey on my dick
Unky mixin' up with rizzy, play the Dickies for the 'fit
Better miss me with the shit, I got the switchy in the whip
