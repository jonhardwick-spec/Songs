[Verse]
I'm rockin' Rhude today to match my mannerism
Ayy, I hit his bitch, if he find out, I bet he have an aneurysm
If you catch Tron out of town, just know he got them scammers with him
If you catch Tron in the store, just know he got them jammers with him
St-Stand on it with both feet, that's how you handle business
Glocky with the button, push the switch, you'd think the channels glitchin'
Havana or the Esko, you won't catch me Camel-hittin'
Headed to the palace, walkin' in my Lanvin sandals, drippin'
Pendants lit up from the sun, you'd think it's solar panels in 'em
You just jeffin' with that sword, you ain't finna go battle with it
Heard these hoes want a chance, gon' make 'еm buy some raffle tickets
Blowin' za on Halloween, thе leaf got candy apples in it
75 on bullshit, 'll have my granny smack you bitches
Shit, 75 on bullshit, I'ma backstreet it
Feel like Krampus, shit, I'm half-GOAT, half-demon
I'm on campus out in Lansing, cuddy servin' college students
Tryna bring these hoes up out they shell, I bet this bottle do it
I've been tryna get him to stop talking, bet this hollow do it
I've been tryna fuck this bitch forever, bet this follow do it
Then she get unfollowed, stupid
Million dollars worth of weapons, you'd think Walo shootin'
My life a masterpiece, you'd probably think that Pablo drew it
Paint him with the Drakey like Picasso
Clear Fruit got a four, I got an eighthy in the fronto
Moncler bubble coat, I got my lady in the poncho
Ha, you got baby money, this an eighty-tender combo
Tryna block my blessings, why they play Dee like Deambo?
She just— the dick and play me like a trombone
I just punched Amiri sneaks with bones, I feel like Jon Jones
Treat it like it's
Call of Duty
, click a button, swap poles
Grab the remote control and swap hoes
Huh, how I swap shows
Only God knows what we did
Brodie, he don't give a fuck, he rob hoes and kids
I'll take the, take the chop, roll and spin
I'll take my pop, then take some Wock' and pour it in
Here we go again
Strippers temptin' to me to throw a ten, here we go again
I just scored a pint and poured a ten like here we go again
Here we go again, I gotta ho her friend
I don't know until when, but I'ma hit the road 'til then
Shit, I just want my dick sucked, she just want an outfit
That ain't how I work, you better take the work, head South, bitch
I was at the bottom like, "I gotta get from 'round this"
Tuh, as you can see, I got from 'round that
I've been blowin' zotteroni since they called it loud pack
Tryna fit in scammin' out in Cleveland in my Browns hat
You sip that one shit that come in brown sacks
This a whole three-five of Stilly, watch me drown, Jack
Up tryna count racks
My shooter higher than a fuck, tryna count hats
He ain't high as me, I just heard the money count back
She ain't never made me nut off head, so I ain't count that
Rollin' with the firebomb squad, where his house at?
B-B-Brooklyn Chop House, what's an Outback?
Said he livin' like I am? Shit, I doubt that, I really do
I ain't have fifty slugs, now what the fuck is fifty blues?
Silly goose
