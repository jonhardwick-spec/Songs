[Intro]
I don't stop hustling
This hustling shit like breathing to me
This shit really don't stop
As soon as I wake up it's the first thing I do
(You're not making this easy, Kyle)
It's the first thing I think about, I don't take breaks
This shit three-six-five, two-six-nine
You hear me, clearly
[Verse 1]
The whole team gotta work, from the manager to janitor
Caught him tryna dodge, now his Challenger a massacre
Fuck a thirty day grind, I'ma do the calendarFuck a thirty day grind, I'ma do the calendar
I done made it to the league, you an amateur
LAX trip like I ain't dribble, I'm a traveler
Thought I fell off but I was hanging off the banistеr
D-dollar sign-to the M, I'm the ambassador
[Chorus]
Fuck a thirty day grind, I'ma do the calеndar
Fuck a thirty day grind, I'ma do the calendar
Fuck a thirty day grind, I'ma do the calendar, ha-ha-ha, yeah
The whole team gotta work, from the manager to the janitor
Caught him tryna dodge, now his Challenger a massacre
Fuck a thirty day grind, I'ma do the calendar
Fuck a thirty day grind (I'ma do the calendar), yeah, bitch (DSM)
