Thanks to the card holders
I just wanna thank the card holders
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1]
Keep a tommy gun like the mafia, Shoreline
I was in the storm, you was running from it, Fortnite
Catching jet lag out of town, this my fourth flight
Throw his lil' soul to the sky, up there towards Christ
Got boogers in his eyes, why he sleeping on me?
Gotta pay a roll for a feature, Giovani
Feel like I’m playing freeze tag off this three of Wocky
Trap house like The Walking Dead, you gon’ see a zombie
Ran off like we wouldn’t pop his ass after (What the fuck?)
Who the fuck he think he was? Black Panther?
Bitch ask do I work for Apple, I’m a jack stacker
Feel like Ari 'cause the bitch let me crack after
Grab that L and walk away, you are not winning
I’ll have your street blocked off, we on the lodge with it
He better pray to God, huh, that God with him
Cruise away chop, I’ma let this bitch drop kick him
