[Intro]
I got so much energy(E-E-Enrgy made this one)
[Verse]
Finna speed dial the plug, his number right next to Habibi'sMe and brodie smoked a QP, shit, we toasted like paninis
This ain't ordinary pasta, had to lobster my linguine
Run up in this mansion, I'ma leave it haunted like Luigi
She ain't got no self respect, a hundred pills in her va-gee-gee
See me drippin' all this yeah, they tryna soak it like a squeegee
Bet these .308s'll turn his Nike Tech to a bikini
It don't matter what we drop the juice in, fuck it, grab a Fiji
Hmm, yeah
Drop a four, then a one, watch me fade away just like Nowitzki
I got the code they can't crack, I feel like Da Vinci
Looking in my bank account, someone come and pinch me
You ain't been shit since you left college, Frank Kaminsky
Usually ridin' somethin' that be roarin', but the Tesla silent
If I bring a tester to the function, that's some extra clients
Talkin' 'bout you plugged in, I detect a virus
If it's up then it's stuck, come on, test the science
What I'm smokin', ooey-gooey, this shit got me oozy-woozy
Put a hundred in his winter coat for movin' loosey-goosey
Doggie rolling Reginald, ain't even half high
You done wore that fit for a month, shit, it's bath time
Blow 'em out by halftime
Thought he was creepin' through that field, he caught a land mine
It don't take shit to kill 'em, just a hand sign
Jackpot on top his head, who want the cash prize
?
Gang rep the murder man, ballin' like the Fab Five
That ain't VS1, you got some moissanite and graphite
If I see the hook left, I'ma jab rightYou would think we boxin'
How we lookin', muggin' in the club, you probably think we plottin'Not on y'all though, but these Ms for sure
Thinkin' that he lucky, take the dice and I'ma end his roll
I ain't beefin' with nobody, when I do, they send patrol
Dude missed the last couple months, ain't got no rent no more
His clothes on the curb
If you see me in that big body Rolls, bet I swerveBet he turn ghost
Used to have a semi Glocky, I just turned pro
Know some hoes that turned good, good girls turned ho
Bitch, look at me, can't you see that work show?
Mixin' shrooms with the juice, that's my work flow
Add the 'xotic to the geek kit, I'm in work mode
As much as you be on it, must be livin' off a dirt road
Pull up on yo' block, whip rumblin'
Throw 'em in the trunk, take 'em to the dungeon
Whole gang some giants, you be hangin' with the munchkins
If I pay my shooter all this chicken, doggie dumplings
Heard he got some cold feet, I'm rollin' with the hot heads
Cuddy tryna catch a body, SportsCenter Top 10
Talking 'bout top five, shit, I'm top threeTalking 'bout top two, shit, I'm top one
If it ain't pape', I ain't smilin', that shit not fun
If you ain't shootin', then it's fake and a prop gun
So much ice up on the Audemar, I know my watch numb
Shittyboyz, DogShit Militia
