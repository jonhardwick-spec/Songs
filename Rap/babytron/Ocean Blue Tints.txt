[Intro]
(
DTB, that's a slap
)
[Verse 1: Baby Money]
Ocean blue tint, I'm a shark in the Benz
We don't rap at all, we just talk what we live
You can run off, I'ma off a nigga kid
If I know the brick good, I'ma make them niggas bid
Not used to blowin' Glocks, first gun was the SIG
A nigga say he hate me, probably fucked a nigga bitch
Celine to the floor, from my buckle to the stick
And the whole city love me, got a couple niggas rich
Caught thirty 'bows, I got thirty in my stick
My nigga bond a milli', boy, don't worry, I'ma get you
Your bitch love the gang when she heard that we them niggas
Hundred thousand on me cash, I'm in Oakland buyin' chicken
[Verse 2: 22nd Jim &
BabyTron
]
Glock on me now, ballin' like I play with Pistons
22nd nigga, known for standin' on that business
Niggas try to keep up with the gang, but niggas finishеd
Hit they blocks with them switches, wе ain't leavin' not a witness
Amiri did the jeans, you can tell by the stitches
I just landed in New York, I'm just waitin' on the shipment
Got all your hoes tryna fuck 'cause they know you niggas bitches
Tried to told you I was comin', but you niggas didn't listen
Don't slide down this block unless I give your ass permission
Plain jane Rollie, could've went and bought a business
Drop sixty on the AP, treat the playoff like a scrimmage
We the niggas with the sauce, not the ones who tryna steal it (
Yeah
