[Intro]
Whoomp, there it isWhoomp, there it isWhoomp, there it is
(
Steve-O crowned this beat
)
No top, I’ll slide in that Dawn till it’s dusk (
Whoomp, there it is
)
Bitch
[Chorus]
No top, I’ll slide in that Dawn till it’s dusk
If it’s dilly, I won’t take it, it won’t pawn if it’s crud
F&N, I ain’t hitting dawg with a punch
He ain’t sipping on no drop, he still cough with his cup
You ain’t tryna run it up, type to jog in a rush
First buzzer vibes, knew that I’ll ball from the jump
Ball in a clutch, I’ma ball till the end
If you born a worker, work to be a boss in the end
[Verse 1]
Three different colors on my ice, the kit Neapolitan
Won’t depend on a bitch, all I need is oxygen
So much mud in my system, need some antioxidants
Walking like a penguin, forty ball got me wobbling
Change up еverywhere you go? You a chamеleon
Mari deep fried off the whippits, that ain’t helium
Dog Shit Militia, we off the leash, we ain’t obedient
One me, six sticks, General Grievous
