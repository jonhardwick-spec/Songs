[Intro]
(Damn, JakeSand)
[Verse 1: ScrumbleMan]
Trendin' on Twitter, got me feelin' like a rapper rapper
Cappin' in the booth, little boy you a capper capper
Push start the whip, put it in drive, then I scratch it after
Glock with the switch, got it feeling like a plasma blaster
Walked in the function, got the za in the lunch box
Smokin' three-five of opps, ian gon quit till' my lungs stop
Tron dropped a fo' in the 2 liter it's a fun pop
Throw that shit away, I got some za and a seal of wock
[Verse 2: Babytron]
Red bottoms with the spikes, i'm looking like a porcupine
50 rounder tryna pull up, shoot a opp 40 times
Off-White this and that, but no I ain't snorting lines
Rollie or the Patek, nah you can't afford this time
Feins at the spot, this shit lookin' like a Jordan's line
I-75 South headin' towards Georgia flyin'
Six figures in my bank, bitch im more than fine
Seven figures on the way, just from recording lines
Like bitch punch me in
Sick he bought some sauce, he done gave yo ass a dummy band
Ocky got the local, prolly catch him runnin' in
BabyTron the young goat, you cannot fuck with him
Fit 5 thousand dollars (Shit, Jesus Christ)
Seen 12 left, shit I gotta swing the demon right
Fuck the rap, I might go back to the visa swipes
In Hutch like I got a black eye, shit I need some ice
