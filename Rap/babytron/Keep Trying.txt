[Intro]
(1WayKay, you went off on this bitch)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Hundred dollar if he finna hotbox the booth
Sun beamin' through the Z06, I'm finna drop the roof
They be snakes nowadays, you gotta watch your move
Killed twenty foes, on straight, I'm finna drop a nuke
You ain't the plug, you in the middle like you Malcolm
Dash say two-hundred-somethin', feel like Danny in the Phantom
I done drew it up and mapped it out, I promise, it ain't random (It ain't random)
He don't like me, should I fuck his bitch or hand him?
Wockiana, [?], Trece, I got the juice in
Cut the traction, hang up out the window, let the coupe spin
I just popped a dub, that's two tens
Zacky pulled up on thе [?] plug, he got some new jеans
Hit my soda with a four, it look like pomegranate juice
You might win the game scorin' but you gotta pass it too
Balenciaga sweater like, "Shit, I gotta catch the shoe"
If you wanna pull up to the spot, you gotta grab somethin'
Get the head from her then I throw the peace sign
Down the way, catchin' plays, I'm with BSlime
Me and D-Chase, run after [
?
], we like to D-line
[Chorus: BabyTron,
BabyTron & YNW BSlime
]
Tryna catch up to the game, shit, keep tryin'
Shit, keep tryin', shit, keep tryin'
Tryna catch up to the game, shit, keep tryin'
Shit, keep tryin',
shit, keep tryin'
Tryna catch up to the game, we overlapped them three times
