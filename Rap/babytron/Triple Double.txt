[Intro: Big Money Rich]
Ayy, ayy, BabyTron, I got something for you on this one
Fuck it, all gas, ayy
[Verse 1: Big Money Rich]
Nigga's high so that's why my eyes lazy
I heard somebody said they gon' rob baby
Tryna run in my spot, I'll put a nigga in a suit like a FBI agent
But he told my mans about the shit
But he ain't tell me until they got into it
Nigga pull it on me then you gotta use it
Send a nigga right to God like a Hallelujah
Y'all niggas shake hands for the hype
Tone brung a FN for the night, FN for the night
I just bought a brand new chopper, something light
I just gave 'em weed 'cause they wanna get high
Bitch, I can't see, let me hit the porch light
Ugh, that's a V live Quic? 'Course not, ugh
You in the hood chasing 'round all the stupid bitches
I'm on a plane daydreaming 'bout the stewardess
On the Spirit plane smushed, can't move a shit
Why I ain't fly Delta for the extra six?
Plug gave me two bows with some extra zips
I told him it was one short with a shake a zip
Nigga starving out here, it ain't making sense
I just made 3K when I left the 6
I'ma kill the bitch pussy, put a hearse on her
I'ma pull her skirt up then murk on her
I'ma throw a P back and then Perc' on her
I'm gon' pull my dick out, she gon' twerk on it
And I pray all snitches have the worst daughters
Niggas put the hook on me like the verse over
Choppa hit a nigga crib then split a nigga house like it's a divorce order
