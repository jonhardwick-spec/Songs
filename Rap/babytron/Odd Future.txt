[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat

(
Damn, JakeSand
) Hey
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
The way she suck dick, man, I think this bitch a pornstar
Two chains, 2022, I'm gon' have four charms
Shoot the wheels off that Trackhawk, you won't soar far
European sneakers push the pedal in a foreign car
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Some hoes'll really let you fuck because of who you are
Teacher asked me what I wanna be, I told her ass, "A star"
Do the dash, Ricky Bobby, if the money callin'
I'ma keep shitting on these niggas 'til I'm in a coffin
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Foreign kicks, shooting shit like I'm Gallinari
White Cartiers looking like a plate of calamari
Out in Cali off some Wockiana, I might crash the 'Rari
Drop an opp, go home, then throw his dumb ass a party
[Verse 4: TrDee]
Slim-thick snow bunny, my lil' cocaina
Feet up off the beach, chillin' in my beater
I can be in Cali, man, I'm still ridin' with the heater
Came through and team wiped the gang, this lil' bitch an eater
