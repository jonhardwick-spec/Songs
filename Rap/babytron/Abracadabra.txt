[Verse 1: TrDee]
I just called a number seven 'cause her pussy weak
I was thumbing through some money then you heard a beep
Only time niggas up is when I'm probably sleep
Winter time coming, StanWill went and got a Jeep
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Riding 'round with three hundred shots thinking that I'm Keef
Dawg punched a lil' Nike Tech, now he think he me
Bitch talking 'bout her head fire, think I need to see
I don't really think, if it's online then it mean it's free
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Bitch know I got some jacks in, feel like SandyWill
Dee and Tron keep blowing za, can't stand the smell
All that tough talk, same reason yo mans in Hell
Short-ass nigga, hoes know that my bands XL
[Verse 4: TrDee]
Tiny-ass pockets, I can tell that they ain't doing well
Crazy-ass bitch, I really think her pussy got a spell
Oh, you got a nigga? Sorry, baby, I could hardly tell
EDD is over so he got some new clothes to sell
[Verse 5: BabyTron]
Finna ram this bitch with my horn like a Triceratops
Finna ram this bitch from the back till her cherry pop
Out of town shopping, dragging bags everywhere you not
Only gotta hit two porches, let me wear my Crocs
