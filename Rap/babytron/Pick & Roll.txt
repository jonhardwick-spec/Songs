[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Reuel, stop playing with these niggas
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, huh
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Up a forty ball, fuck around and take a selfie with it
Should've moved if you ain't want to swallow, know she felt me twitching
Ninety jacks flying overnight, yeah, this a heavy shipment
Bitch ain't hear me tell her take her shoes off 'cause the blender spinning
Phone banging, she with three friends, I'm 'bout to four-way it
Riding in them foreigns with them ratchets, had lil' bro clank 'em
No angel, I'm a dickhead, won't tell no ho "thank you"
Can't fuck with no one on my team, I'll have my coach play you
[Verse 2: TrDee]
How ironic, hit hеr in a whip, I did a hit and run
Told her bring her friends, I got my niggas, wе can have some fun
VVSs shining in the dark, I do not need the sun
If the money call before I see you then you getting spun
If you wanna try me, I can bet you it won't end like that
If I see some season, I can bet you I'ma send it back
When they watching porn, the only time these niggas see a rack
When I'm with yo bitch, the only time I'm really with a rat
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Slipping out of Neiman's, I done walked out with some splash, huh
If you see me out, just know you see me with the MAG, huh
Heard they looking for me, bitch, I'm somewhere in my bag, huh
I'll never stop the fraud, I made twenty off my last run
Yeah, waving blick around, blew sticky now
I find it silly how I was human but I'm billy now
Tearing giffies down, was broke but can up fifty now
Really in my bag, could never let you bitches get me out
