[Part I]
[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy
I be thuggin' in myâ€” hey
[Verse 1: BabyTron &
Certified Trapper
]
I be thuggin' in my Jordans, if I'm in the Ricks, I'm bored
Like LeBron in the paint, if I shoot, I'ma score
Bucket hat, swim trunks, I might scooch through, Dior
If the opps downstairs, then I'm shootin' through the floor
Shit, we comin' through your chimney, turn your roof to a door
I can show you how to cook, come and do you a course
Phew, we turnin' twos into fours
Mesmerized how they stick, it's the blues I adore
Goin' hard in the paint, on my arm day to daySmush a nigga, pancake, smack switchy on the Drac'
Hit him for that French toast, his head dented like a waffle
Militia steppin' in the club, eleven bezels, fuck the bottles
[Verse 2: Certified Trapper]
Tryna stop the drank, but I can't
Jimmy whipped out Five-seveN, left his face on my Bapes
Tell 'em fuck the prosecutor, I'll kill the DA
Pockets got lumps, why? They filled with the pape'
