[Intro]
Now let's get something straightNow let's get something straightNow let's get something straight
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
[Verse]
Now let's get something straight
First class Delta flights, I'm above the hate
I was down looking up, now I'm up some pape'
It could be worst, God ain’t have to let me up today
Teacher ain't fuck with me because I would come in late
Woke up 100K, I ain't never touch an A
For every class that I failed, I'ma flood the bank
Threw a
brick
on the gas pedal, I’m like, "Fuck the brake," ha-ha
Yeah,
SB
, we the team
Started off a seed but we turned into a tree
Had ten dollars but it turned into a sleeve
Used to be friendly but I turned into a beast
That's what happens, ducking snakes in the Amazon
Cracking cards, I'm an ape in the Scamazon
Good Runtz, what's this planet I landed on?
Oh shit, never mind, this a star I'm standing on
Talking 'bout we kin? LOL, whatever, cousin
God walking to me, whole time the Devil running
Fraud God, I'm at the self-scan pressing buttons
Feel like Jimi Hendrix, I'm at Hard Body's metal clutching
Said he fucking with me? Tell him hang himself
Heart jumped out my chest from the pain I felt
A bitch gon' be a bitch, bro, take that L
I was finna drown, bitches left, they ain't stay and help
Bitch heard my song like, "Yeah, he sweet for sure"
Up chop and let it go like I'm Keyshia Cole
In a different world with it, C-3PO
Do you know what I could do off of three Visas, bro?
I ain't finna battle with you, this ain't Pokémon
Chopstick got a light, feel like Obi-Wan
Finna slam dunk this ho, Dee throwing lobs
Setting plays up, I think I need a coaching job
Who not winning? Lil' bitch, you a stupid fuck
Elevating to a different level like a Buddhist monk
You gon' need kryptonite to stop a super punch
Old head talking 'bout the past? Gotta prove it, unc'
Shooter got a Ray Gun, they thought I sent an alien
He spent Curry in the mall, left with Damian
If I up it, I'ma probably stretch his cranium
A hundred shots, fuck a jab, this ain't WrestleMania
I'm with Prince, double cup full of Purple Rain
Forza 3 type shit when I'm swerving lanes
You're a clerk, I'm a swiper, we don't work the same
They ain't see the wave coming, hit 'em with a hurricane
Ain't no ho's here, man, I bet Stan chalk 'em
Thinking that he balling? Knock the headband off him
Demons taking over, this the dead man talking
Black skinnies, black goose, this the dead man walking, ha-ha
Give his ass a tombstone, Undertaker
Was in church with some gift cards up my blazer
I ain’t buy it in the mall? I'ma punch it later
Love the love but most importantly, I love the haters
