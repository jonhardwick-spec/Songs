[Verse 1: Almighty Suspect]
Twenty-seven in the .30, that bitch won't jam
Dawg blew his whole EDD, nigga, get yo mans
You got them petty-ass chains, should've spent more bands
I'ma diss that lil' bitch, she ain't fit my plan
Moncler coat, give a fuck if it's sunny out
Ho said I'm broke, bitch, where? Pull the money out
Bought four pints, put 'em up, nigga, fuck a drought
Do this shit for the bands, nigga, fuck some clout
[Verse 2: KrispyLife Kidd]
Keep the car running, I'm going in and coming out
She about to hit this button then I'm up another thousand
You better off fighting, don't nobody shoot up houses
Strong niggas get left red, Larry the Lobster
That bitch shoot nine bullets, that ain't no chopper
In a nigga bushes, hе thought he seen a Chupacabra
On a loose-ass day I got on Prada
On another loosе-ass day I count up twenty thousand
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Woke up high as hell, Eggos with the Wockhardt
Like, shit, it might've been the Runtz and the Pop-Tarts
Dunking with the Glock like Drexler, you cannot guard
I'm a rock star, fucking hoes like a pop star
Man, why this bitch just call me "Thrustin Bieber"?
Best dressed back in high school, I could've fucked the teacher
Dawg was talking crazy, now it's fucking maggots underneath him
Running scams up fast as hell like a fucking cheetah
