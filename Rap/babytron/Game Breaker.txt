[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I got something that you don't and it's called talent
Fuck Fortnite, scamming is my daily challenge
Word jumped like Monstars, it's jumping off the fucking planet
Talking 'bout bank accounts? You got zero in that balance
You ain't fuck up the mall, the mall fucked you up
I was tripping last summer off that seven plus
Green Balencis on my feet, looking like some 7-Up
Bro pull up with that Super Soaker, watch him wet 'em up
Rockstar jeans and I got the Robins too
Dawg dick sucking but his bitch slobbing too
Came from the mud so I got a lot to prove
Visa this, Visa that, you know I got a lot of blues
Talking 'bout wrestling, do I look like CM Punk?
Talking 'bout swiping, you ain't ever seen a dump
Caught a dirtball but this choppa, it’ll clean 'em up
Asking God to bless me, I feel the Devil creeping up
[Verse 2: StanWill]
MCM on my waist, fuck a WCW
Balling on these niggas, busting ass, that’s what hustle do
Setting plays on the team, you can get yo huddle blew
Relly Rell got the .9 tucked, he won't tussle you
Seven hun' on some shoes I ain't laced up
Fuck that, fit still a band from the waist up
Shit on MCM Worldwide so they hate us
I ain’t snap you for nothing, bitch, get a face up
When we slide, better duck like dynasty
If you have the Robins too, you can come fly with me
Green on me, I'm a veggie boy, I don't like the beef
Bro threw the punches at me, nah, he ain’t fighting me
Yes, bitch, I'm on my grind till I hit a bubble
Yes, bitch, fit wet as hell, I'm a walking puddle
Three niggas up ten, that's a triple-double
Call the plug 'cause he got more punches than Royal Rumble
