Yeah, okay, let me catch the beat
On a scam trip, won't stop till the quest complete
Blocky-ass blue Balenciagas, I got Tetris feetTold the bitch suck my dick till the soul exit me
Caught a first class trip to Cali with a extra seatShe ain't gotta beat it, you can tell she really feeling me
Feel like Derrick Henry, made a thigh pad in Tennessee
Hoodie say "Friends", got a Glock for my enemies
Met a lil' bitch from the Saks, she on balls nowWalked in with the racks, could'vе bought the mall out
You ain't do no balling, you just probably took the ball outPull up to her crib to rеally only knock her walls out
Three-five after three-five, I might fall out
Walking in with a fake check, might have to jog out
Think I got a scam GPS, I took the fraud routeThey gon' have to hopscotch his corpse, got him chalked out
Bitch told me she don't suck dick, I damn near walked outCaught a play out in the A, I'm like a hawk now
I'm thinking 'bout how many jacks I caught, I done lost count
Off-White sneaks, scuff 'em once, they get tossed out
I ain't have shit, funny how it shit I talk nowFuck yo lil' Scat, Dre Tracking, get it hawked down
Tryna dap me up like I forgot when they talk downNumber one rule with these hoes, you do not hound
Either punching in the booth or somewhere punching up a card
Bitch, I'm blowing real za, I'm floating up there with the stars
When you was little playing house, I was running in the yardThink I popped a V pill, bitch, I'm coming twice as hard
Brodie on the block and he ain't nothing like a guardThink I'm kinda weird, thumbing through it make me hard
Real life GTA, bust you jumping out the car
Yeah, you can use yo feet but you ain't running off that far
You might think he is but, nah, they ain't dripping sauce like oursI'm in the wrong pocket at the strip, I got to tossing cards
You really let that nigga think he crazy? He ain't even hardYou are not a killer if you scared to end up with a charge
Off-Wheezy on the shirt made by Abloh
Getting top in the whip, top gone, my socks gone
All this Bitcoin, I could fuck around and stock brokeOn the West gunslinging, shoot him out his poncho
