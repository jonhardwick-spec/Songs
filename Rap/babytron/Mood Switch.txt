[Verse 1: BabyTron]
My wrist, that's your salary
Bitch, we'll pull up swingin' sticks like a Valkyrie
You won't catch the the kid up in the middle, you can't Malcolm me
My CPN name Danny, hit the lot and tell 'em Phantom me
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
I'll walk out with a quarter-ticket just so casually
At the exotic store (
Damn, JakeSand
), huh
At the exotic pop store, I told them boys, "White Peach Fanta" me
In the deep, I'm kinda hard to find, I'm like a manatee
You ever found a thousand in your laundry randomly?
How the fuck is you a scammer? Every time you jam, it freeze
You say you eatin' good, what I imagine's Applebee's
Lawyers, they just want they monеy, finna pay the shackle fees
Knock the corе up out your apple if you try to grapple me
If you seen what I been through, it's no way you'd be mad at me
I can do a verse in five minutes, song in fifteen
Still undefeated, y'all boys lookin' like the sick siege
Stone Island breaker on me, had to check the wind speed
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Miltia, let's get it
[Verse 2: TrDee]
With the gravediggers, they got first-class trips to Heaven
Hit her after me, that bitch a blunt, or like sloppy seconds
I could wake up bitches, bless a bitch, I feel like a reverend
No cap, ShittyBoyz shit, man
Before we leave the game, I bet they call our ass the greatest
Shit be crazy, I remember when they used to hate us
I'ma have to ball until they put me in them cages
Bad-ass bitch, lightskin with some braces
Back against the wall, I was still ten toes
Bitch think she bad, but she is not that cold
We'll put some cheese on 'em like some nachos
Only 'cause he wanted beef like some tacos
Young G.O.A.T. status, I might just go buy a farm
She knew who I was soon as she seen me and my charm
SBDSM, might get it tatted on my arm
Niggas sleepin', I'ma wake 'em up like a alarm
