[Intro: BabyTron]
(We gon' box 'em in the moment that they—, bitch)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
We gon' box 'em in the moment that they drop the pin
They stopped ahki on the road and tried to roll block his wins
Same motherfuckers preachin' to me, I done watched 'em sin
And the same bitch say she loyal, I done watched her choose
Same burger actin' like he winnin', I done watch him lose
Told brodie watch my back, and I'ma watch his too
Opposition think it's shits and giggles 'til they rockin' suits
Cream soda on Majin Buu
Yeah, I ain't got no dreads, so I can't tеll you how life lookin' through my rasta's view
Knocked thе noodles out his top and give him pasta shoes
Bitch, I'm a boss, you can't tell me what I'm not gon' do
Bitch, I'm a boss, move when I'm walkin' through
She put that head on me at noon, I ain't get off 'til 2
He a one-season star player, ain't get off 'til June
I drift off in Zoom and I just spilled all my juice
Start a war with the Militia, gon' kill all his troops
Dee'll send them dogs on the loose, ha-ha-ha
I just went raw in his boo, ha-ha-ha
Roll up twenty logs, they get blew, ha-ha-ha
Watch me put the ball in the hoop, we stacked it tall, through the roof (Ha)
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Zaza in the raw paper got me in here lyrical (Whew)
Bitch took my soul, got me in the room spiritual (Shit, fuck)
It's crazy when you losin', it ain't nobody to cheer for you (Why?)
Got caught dog walkin', he ain't even got no vehicle (Grrt, ha)
He never had money, when he got it, it ain't last long
Man, that bitch is average, that ain't even shit to brag on
You might just get hit in your shit, bro, put your pads on
Finna get a laser for my Glock like we at Zap Zone (Ha-ha-ha, ah)
I don't roll with 60's but my pockets full of blues like Smurfs
You never know, might hit you with a deal, bro, come get a verse
Shit be off the top, I swear to God, bro, this is not rehearsed (Nah)
This forever up, I swear to God we gotta do 'em worse
Don't pull up with no weed if you ain't pullin' up with diesel (Don't do that)
AR-15, fuck around and Austin Reaves you (Brrt)
Niggas burn bridges, turn around and might need you (Dummy)
I'm a rich loner, I don't really like people
