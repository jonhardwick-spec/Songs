I hope my ex dives into a pool of
I hope my ex dives into a pool of gas, alright
I hope my ex dives into a pool of gas with a lighter in her pocket
I hope an active shooter runs into the Meijer's while she shopping
I hope she goes through pregnancy, then have a miscarriage
You can't really blame her, you gotta blame that bitch parents
I hope that bitch falls down a thousand flights of stairs
I hope it hits her like a linebacker that life ain't fair
I hope that bitch loses all her friendsThen meets a whole new group then lose 'em all again
I hope the Kia Boys find her new car
I hope she knows when that bridge burn, it ain't no new start
I hope she know she lost a breadwinner
Hope she know I'm rolling up her cousin and his friends with him
I hope a bitch smack her so hard, it leaves her head spinning
I hope that bitch learns the sauce out and the feds get her
I hope that bitch purse get stolen
I hope she gets sidetracked the second that she gets focused
I hope her job fires her and she gets evicted
Hope her house catches on fire while she stuck up in the kitchen
I hope her hair gets caught up in the elevator doors
I hope she knows her new man's poor and I'm making more
I hope mosquitos bite her back where she can't reach
I hope something happens to her eyesight where she can't see
I hope the very worst for that hoI hope a witch makes a hex and puts a curse on that hoOr the Based God
I hope she knows that now we ain't a thing, she just a lame now
I hope she pops a Percocet that's heavy on the fetty
Shit, I hope she know she's petty, wasn't even worth a Hot-N-Ready
I should have my new ho come through just to beat her ass
Was a bum before I met her, like you should've seen her ass
I hope she grabs the last slice of pizza and drops it
Hope my youngin' gets a hold of her Visa and pops it
Never mind, it probably ain't no money on that bitch (Huh)
She bet' not hit my jack, I'm acting funny on a bitch
Only thing that's dirty as that bitch is my pop
Only thing that's dirty as them two is my Glock
Only thing that's dirty as them three is my chop'
Ho said she eating good, it's EBT when she shops
I hope she swims out in the ocean and some sharks attack her
I hope a hunnid more times that her heart get shattered
I hope she breaks all ten nails
I hope she ends up in a cell and no one sends bail
Living my best life, I mean the best life and I hope she knows it
I hope she knows she lost a champion, lil' bitch, I'm trophy holdin'
Fuck that ho
It ain't shit to have my lil' cousin pull up, bust that ho, ayy
