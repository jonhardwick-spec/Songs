(
Wait, turn that up, that's a JAY C beat?)(MIA JAY C)(It's Lando, yo bitch know, don't let yo bitch go, nigga
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Hand me the heavyweight belt, I'm the Scam Champ
I done touch two hundred X, I'm the Jack Man
Thinking that he big, turn him into Ant-Man
Bitch, I wouldn't DC if I was Batman
Huh, and the whip look like a Batmobile
You drive a 2012, bitch, that ain't a Scat, for real
"What's that noise in the back?" Rio cracked the seal
Caught him in the park and shot his ass, that's a Jurassic kill
That means I turned him to a fossil
I'm in church banging this, I'm like, "Fuck some gospel"
In this bitch windpipe, I'm like, "Fuck some tonsils"
Shooter busting off the crotch rocket, clutching on the throttle
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Huh, yeah, we on a different wave
Feds tried to hit bro with the book, he on a different page
Smart as hell, but when she giving head, she use a different brain
Skrrt-skrrt, swerving on your bitch in a different lane
ShittyBoyz X Flint, we talk dumb and dumber
Big four Nicky to the belly, this a tummy tucker
I ain't gon' lie, if bro miss, he a lucky fucker
'Cause it got the beam and a scope, better duck and cover
Bro hit the water two times, that's a déjà blue
If I could marry rap, dawg, I would say, "I do"
But I'm blessed off the scams like I said achoo
It would take more than a cape just to save your boo
