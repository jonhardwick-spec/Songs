[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
Bitch, ayy
Yeah, ayy
Skrrt
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bitch, I'm finna blow the trans
Bitch, I'm finna blow his mans
Modern-day pimp'll smack a bitch with an open hand
Said the ShittyBoyz broke, doggy must be smokin' Xans
Off-White tee, Off-White sneaks
Gang back to back in Yeezies, guess they all Hypebeast
Bad temper, keep it pushin' when you walk by me
When I close my eyes, blue hundreds all I see
Call of Duty
weapon, got an AR with a shell catcher
Ghost chili talker in the booth, boy, you a bell pepper
Stay up in the crowd 'cause you ain't really never felt prеssure
All the lines of rеd that I'm pourin', need a spell checker
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Yeah, put some racks on him like Serena, send him up to Venus
Stump an opp in Fear of God kicks, send you up to meet him
Bad hoes in SRTs, guess I'm stuck with demons
Designered down, whippin' racks out, she gon' suck this penis
Yeah, lil' rude-ass shit talkin', rich fucker
Scamin'-ass 201, slidin' drip puncher
Never lackin', I'ma trigger happy blick clutcher
I should buy a fuckin' bra, the chop got some tits on it
Drippin'-ass rich fuck, Mike Amiri swim trunks
We got hit sticks tucked, who the fuck gon' blitz us?
Ksubi jeans ripped up, would never hear no R.I.P us
Bitch lookin' like who is they? We the shit, duh
