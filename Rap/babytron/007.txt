[Intro]
(Enrgy made this one)
Yeah
Huh
[Verse]
I’m scared of Enrgy, he pulled up swerving in a 'Vette
BIN Reaper, at the self scanner working in my tech
Fiends in the trap, no cap, serve 'em out the rec'
Saks Fifth, Neiman Marcus, shit, I'm splurging with a check
Groupie ho let me fuck her off the punch lines
Bend her over, windmill, shit, it's dunk time
Chopper Justin Bieber, let it sing for the one time
(
I'ma tell you onе time
)
Ten or bettеr party, please don’t even try and up five
Finna use the CPN, bitch, I'm a credit booster
War time, pay my hitman, bitch, I invest in shooters
Nah, for real, a hundred sticks, gon' need some extras troopers
Dog chain ain't pass the diamond tester, need to check his jeweler
Overlapping competition, I'm gon' need a gold medal
Bougie bitch with me smoking za out a rose petal
2022, I'm tryna fuck up Coachella
Pillow talker, doggy on the phone with the hoes telling
CPL
on me, I ain't no felon
Chain water, reach for this bitch, I'm popping bro melon
I'ma creep up on him with the stick, 007
For my scam rookies, drive south, that's a pro message
I was scoring six in the city back with Jahvid Best
Treat his dumb ass like Draymond, he can't dodge the TEC
Walking out of Chase with a smile, I just got a check
Three-five of, uh, I can't say it, shit, I'm out of breath
Hundred rounder, fifty drummer, shit, we left his house a mess
Firebomb his whole shit, now his house a deck
Spent fifty getting 'round, that was just without the jet
On my way to eat steak at Fleming's running out the set
Shoot to Birmingham, shit, I'm finna go Revive shop
Star player on the court, I'm higher than the skybox
Caught an eye shot, we done turned him to a cyclops
On the dark web, 201s, hope these slides pop
High as hell in the booth, really, I'm just freestyling
Crib far, drive to it, you gon' need mileage
Me, Dee, and James hit the Runtz, turned to three pilots
Hit his bitch on FaceTime, now he crying
Add cheese on his dumb ass, now he minus-ed
Had to turn Dora off 'cause I'ma keep swiping
Tryna catch up to BabyTron, yeah, keep trying
Seen the boss coming to the counter, finna sneak by him
Chinese V-cut turn me into Gogeta
B22s cost a band, these ain't no Filas
Huh, shit, BIN master, scam star, all I know's Visas
Running up a check, damn near turned into a whole cheetah
Pouring eights, enough Wocky for a four liter
She a whole cheater, you a dummy if you don't leave her
Bitch bad, blocking shots like a goalkeeper
Got it out the mud on my dolo, ain't need no teacher
