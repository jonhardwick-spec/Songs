[Intro]
(
Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby
)
Brrt, phew
Ha, yeah (Brrt)
[Chorus]
I just had a out of my body moment off these Perky-Yerkys
If they flick me, dump it out the window, shit, you know this thirty dirty
You was catching Zs, I cannot relate, bitch, I'm the early birdie
Cuddy wrist work top tier, tremendous, gave the dope twirly-whirlies
I just had a out of my body moment off these Perky-Yerkys
If they flick me, dump it out the window, shit, you know this thirty dirty
You was catching Zs, I cannot relate, bitch, I'm the early birdie
Cuddy wrist work top tier, tremendous, gave the dope twirly-whirlies
[Verse 1]
Yo' time comin' up like tick-tock, tick-tock (Brrt)
Time is money, watch my wristwatch drip-drop (Shit)
SBDSM got big chops, big Glocks (Brrt, brrt)
Ain't shit stop
Slide around equipped, don't get popped, don't get shot
Silly dumb bitch left me at the lowest, fucked up and that ho know it
R.I.P. $cam, got a pint, wish we could pour it
So much pain, I don't show it
Everyone tryna tell me I'm chosen like I don't fuckin' know it (Brrt)
Had to grab the new Trackhawk fully loaded (Skrrt)
Hit a bump so quick, I'm floatin'
