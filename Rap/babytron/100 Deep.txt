[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I ain't wrestling, metal to his head like he Scott Steiner
Buffalos, I might do the Celine but I don't rock wires
You don't wanna rap battle, boy, I'm Supa Hot Fire
Road runner, only thing that's stopping me, a popped tire
Got down, self-revived then I won the game
Time to get him gone, tell my shooter I'ma up his pay
I don't need a Aspirin, I'll sip the double cup for pain
Knew I had grind, I made a hunnid in a hunnid days
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Thought he was a killer, how the fuck he end up in a grave?
Popping out with that vest? Boy, you really brave
Kicks cost a arm and leg, shirt Human Madе
Just text my old bitch, "I know you wish that you stayed"
Just caught a play and it ain't evеn close to ten o'clock
Unc' is tripping in a vest, spin the block, spilling Wock'
Chilling in the trap, grab the chop when you hear a knock
Feel like David, boy, with this bitch, I'm finna let it rock
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Had to shake him up to get some answers, Magic 8 Ball
Phone ringing for that money, had a great call
LeVon's looking like I shot 'em with a paintball
Nobody does it better, shit, I feel like Nate Dogg
