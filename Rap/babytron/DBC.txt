Don't brag about ten thousand, that's real light
Kit full of rеal ice, my shit look like real lights
If you wanna book me, twenty, that's the real price
Really can't be fucked with, that's what I feel like (That's what I feel like)
I like my bitches ass fat, pussy real tight (Huh?)
Lil' waist, BBL, that's my real type (On the yeah side)
I live in a mini-mansion, my shit real nice
Four hundred thousand for a kit just to shit on niggas
My young nigga gettin' fifty for a headtap (Fah)
Niggas keep sendin' threats, we ain't playin' that (We ain't playin' that)
He say he up more than me, I can't stand crack (Can't stand crack)
I think this nigga drunk, Coach, he need to stand back (Huh?)
Cut into a cold bitch like, "Where your man at?" (Where your man at?)

Young nigga, rich as fuck, still savin' racks
