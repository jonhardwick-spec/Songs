1Hunnit
You know, I'm just tryna help niggas see the bigger picture
You know, give them a little bit more understanding of this shit, you feel me?
[Verse 1: J1Hunnit]
I'm lookin' at the world through a magnifying glass, I like it up close and personal
I'm an Earthling, but the 'za got me higher than a Martian though
You know they tryna sneak in through the back, you gotta close the door
I keep it player, I'll smack her ass and then hold the door
Shit-talkin' daily, I wash my mouth out with bars of soap
On 4th Street, they label me the G.O.A.T., I gave them niggas hope
You probably thought the rap was really doin' it, but I was servin' dope
Made a couple thousand speakin' fluеntly, now I'm paid per show
I wholesale P's, but I usеd to get paid per O
Money off the skate, like SBs, I used to dunk the lows
You know the best ticket in the city
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I could make a bitch cry off this onion roll
Woke up, four lines to pour and three blunts to smoke
P's so fire, ask the plug, "Can I punch some dope?"
Me and brodie slid, Durk and Vez, we gon' up the score
In that Raptor, grab the hatch, then fill the trunk with 'bows
At the laundromat the only time you touch the load
Gettin' down to zero, that's what put me into hustle mode
Fly OT, locate the bag, and then I'm comin' home
Put a hole in my lung, in here puffin' strong
First time I ever upped the pole, the opps was runnin' home
