[Chorus]
I watched my mans turn into a snake just like an Animorph
Triple S-ing
,
Turbo S-ing, pedal pressing, crash the Porsche
You a duck like Oregon, I hear it's beef, go grab a fork
Unky said he Adam Silver if they turn the trap to sport
I wish I had some Act' to pour, Amiri jeans, attach the torch
I ain't going back and forth, a hundred shots, go ask the Lord
Ahki office looking like an orchard, shit, it's jacks galore
I wanna share the sunlight, but they couldn't even stand the storm
[Verse]
Duh, I scam, but I'll fuck around and come and cash the store
Out here trusting bitches, that's a dork, I be done smacked a whore
On the 8 like Eminem, me and Ju, we done matched a four
Vintage tee, but I ain't hit the
thrift shop like Macklemore
Glocky with the switch'll make a giant look small
Hungry for the opps, I'm lookin'
Asian tryna cook dog
It's a dirty game, the refs ain't lookin', I might push off
Skinnies with the pads, in the field like it's football
Belt to ass season, walk him down, I might just whoop dog
Teach his dumb ass a lesson
I see it's syrup on your pancakes, I drunk that for breakfast
850 out in Dallas in that one bag in Texas
Don't even ask about the sneaks I'm wearin', they ain't out
Ain't never drove a snowplow, but I paved the route
DSM the gang, you disrespectin', we gon' bang it out
Get the drop and stake his house
I was made to be great and I waited, what's to hate about?
Once it's up, you'll never ever see that flame put out
Once it's stuck, we can't face to face and handshake it out
Fuck the opps, whack they brothers, fuck they sisters, serve they uncles fetty
Chillin' like a villain in the middle of the jungle ready
