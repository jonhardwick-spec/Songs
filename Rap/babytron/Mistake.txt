[Intro: KrispyLife Kidd]
(
Stupid Dog, I ain't gon' lie, this bitch hard
)
KrispyLife!
(
It's with a K, dumbass
)
Alright
[Verse 1: KrispyLife Kidd]
Big tripping, low-key need an intervention
Bro keep pouring all these fours, he don't really want no kidneys
Your chain trash, your shit made out a bag of nickels
Catch me on the north side of Flint, with different pistols
.33 My Grant Hill, I play for the Pistons
To say that dog talk spicy like me, you must be tripping
Bro shot a nigga fifty times and I minded my business
Niggas only come around when their card stop hitting
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Smoking ice caps, two puffs and my heart gon' freeze
3-1-3, 8-1-0, tapped in with RMC
Well known VISA thief, watch the card go beep
No I ain't Virgil, but this beam is gon' mark his tee
Gucci kicks with the planets on 'em, these some marching sneaks
Glock 40 put  him in a dream like he Martin King
On an island on some hungry shit, I want some shark to eat
Shooter pull up and off your set like he Cardi B
