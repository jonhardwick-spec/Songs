[Verse 1: Young Dreaded]
Walked in the Hip-Hop Lab, like, goddamn, we got work to do
Shorty want a pill, I'm like, OK, I got a perc for you
Say you get it in, OK, but I ain't heard of you
Prolly smell that Za-Za, everytime Young Dread is swerving through
I got a nice cougar bitch I think she 32
I got a young bitch in Flint, she pop pills and sip dirty too
Said you want a verse for free? Hell na, boy, the nerve of you
You better pay in blues, and you better pull up early too
[Verse 2: PM Capo]
Popped at a nigga, took him out his shoes, I know they heard me too
Fuck on your bitch for 62 minutes, that's what the perkys do
Wintertime, I just [?] my bitch, it's kinda furry too
[?] bag, we was toating 32's
Bad bitch told me pull up on bond, she tryna line me up
I heard that these was tracking my line [?] still tryna fine but
[?] knock him out his Nike Dunks
Bitch mad I bust in 2 minutes, I hit her with like 3 pumps
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Hundred dollar eighthy bitch, I'm passed blowed
50,000 on me, mean mugging, I'm an asshole
Hundred meter dash, you gotta run, but it won't last long
Pull up with that bushmaster laser and the flash on
I might buy a bitch a gift, but she can't get no love
Thought you was the source, fucked up, you need to fix your plug
Let me see an opp in here, I'ma strip the club
Whole life, it felt like I was losing, had to get some dubs
