Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat

Ooh shit
[Verse 1]
I had a D in English class
but I was grade A with that reader writer (Reader writer, reader writer)
Picked up pints and peas up out the farm, I feel like Peter Piper
I was thinking bigger, y'all can use it, we gon' be suppliers
Ron stay with a script like he Peter Jackson
Diving in the crowd to catch a play, that's Derek Jeter action
Set up shop in Iowa and fuck up Cedar Rapids
I got some chicken, cheese, and green like a Caesar salad
Yamaha
, brodie sliding on a ATV
Supreme Timbs, came a long way from
ACG
s
He a role player on his team, call him “KCP”
Blowing Russian Creams, Drac’d up like the KGB
Smoking two Runtz, it taste like yams mixed with mac and cheese
Tryna drive a manual off Quagen, I might smack a tree
Eric Emanuel, the shorts chilling at the beach
MIA, all these plugs, I might grab a key
A dollar in the drum, he better have some juggernog
Bitch, I’ve over up, nah, I ain’t no underdog
White sticks, chocolate tint, lens like a Wonderball
Bitch acting weird, ain’t need a knife when I cut her off
I was off the porch, you live the sports life
We can split the pizza, tell my bro to grab his fourth slice
First classer, it say main cabin when you board flights
Finna tear yo bitch walls down like it’s Fortnite
Not to mention that the robbers looting in yo crib
Sipping out the baby bottle but ain’t drooling in a bib
While I’m popping, let go, I been fooling since a kid
When I’m shooting at his rim I ain’t hooping in a gym
I done caught a hat
Spinning in a Redeye, fucked around and caught a flat
Fuck some morning sex, you ever woke up, caught a jack
That’s what get me going
I’ma short him, if he call back, tell him my digi broken
Shit
