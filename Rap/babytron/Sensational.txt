[Intro: StanWill &
BabyTron
]
Bitch
Ayy
Yes, it is a certified hit
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Moose Knuckle on, tryna punch a Goose
Lying to my bitch like fuck the truth
Mike Amiris on like fuck some Trues
PhD in the fraud like fuck some school
China debit, hit the clerk with [?]
Chop got a telescope and a laser beam
Doggy bone a superhero, he saving cheese
Bitch, I'ma ball for the times I ain't make the team
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I just made a MJ off them Tar Heels
Caught him in his whip, bullets made him do a cartwheel
And if the Glock don't beat him then my arms will
If money don't pull her in then the cards will
Running 'round throwing bullets like Lamar Jackson
Hulk smash with this punch, I'll start havoc
Ain't shit fake, bitch, but my heart plastic
Scored a point last second, that's the March Madness
