[Verse 1: BabyTron]
If we catch him out of town, gon' rearrange his rental
Speedracin' in these Christian Loubies, finna paint the pedal
(Phew)
Pray to God, but when it's time to send a hit, I gotta pay the devil
[Verse 2: Prince Jefe &
Beno

Shoot her baby daddy in the mouth, rearrange his dental (Pew, pew, pew)
I ain't got time to sit down, I sit 'caine in rentals (Yeah)
Bitch, just give me the bank card, let's make it simple (Let's make it simple,
Stupid Dog, I ain't gon' lie—
)
SK on stage, used to play the pistol (Bitch)
And my young niggas kill you if we got an issue (On God)
Would'vе did it back then, but I'm thinkin' bigger (Thinkin' bigger)
Kick thе bitch out the car, she just lit a Swisher (Ho)
I'm a hall of fame jugger, you a Derek Fisher (Jugg)
Used to be the man back then, damn, what happened? (

[Verse 3: Beno &
Drego
]
Uh, gotta watch out for these niggas tryna backstab me
Uh, and got the headshot last night, she said, "Cash App me"
And my bitch got a loose dub in her Gucci fanny
And she popped two RP twenties, she don't fuck with Xannies
Man, I just spent seventeen hundred on a fuckin' hoodieI'll pull a hundred out, yop, in all twentiesHe cap packin' with the bag, he sellin' all CookieIf the dope route slow up, I'm sellin' all Whoopi
And I'm on the block sellin' 'caine, totin' fullies
Sippin' champagne, rockin' Rolexes, playin' with your bitch pussy
Feelin' on me all in the club, gave me a woody
Slidin' down your block in a seventy-deuce cuddy
Rim blowin' kisses, yeah, your bitch said she love me (Right)
You wonder why they call me unky?
Uh, 'cause I'm sellin' all this smack to your favorite auntie
Uh, get it in by any means, I love them blue face hundreds
My fiend call, say, "Halloween," when she want some pumpkins (Hello?)
Right
