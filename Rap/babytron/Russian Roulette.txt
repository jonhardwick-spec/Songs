[Verse 1]
Thirty days, no drank, the monkey on my back
Dreaming 'bout robbin' a bank like, put the money in the bag
You won't hear him crack a joke, ain't got no money in his pants
I guess that life done hit him hard, was always funny back in class
You don't get paid to laugh
They askin' for the recipe? Shit, it was made from scratch
They askin' for the recipe, shit, I'll bake a batch
Wocky man was finna walk out, wait, I need an eight of that, I need an eight of that
