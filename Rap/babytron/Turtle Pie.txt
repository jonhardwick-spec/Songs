[Intro: Lil Yachty]
(Oh, it wasn't produced by RJ? Throw the beat away)
I know damn—
I know damn well you ain't come in here sipping fake Tris
I be sipping Quagen with a tongue twist
I know you ain't come in here sipping fake Tris
I be sipping Quagen, got a tongue twist
I be sipping on Quagen with a tongue twist
Oh, shit
[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I know you ain't come in here sipping fake Tris
I be sipping on Quagen, say it with a tongue twist (Quagen)
I put ice on my arm like I stung my wrist (Ice)
Got a pop full of Tuss', it's a cup of piss (Yeah)
Outside, really shining, I ain't hard to miss (Hey)
Doggy use his sights, he ain't tryna miss (Blatt)
Doggy use his knife, wrap it in his fist (Go)
Okay
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Pull the stick out, Twist of Fate likе I'm Matt Hardy
Japanese steak, been a minutе since I had Arby's
Lil' bro kicked out of school 'cause he snatched Cartis
Last time doggy had ten was at his grad party
Do the dash, catch a opp, and I'ma park his whip
Embosser, MSR, 201s, that's my starter kit
Bro just popped some Bel-Air and did the Carlton
White buffs from Hutch, walked out with the darkest tint
