[Intro]
It's Lando, yo' bitch know, don't let yo' bitch go, nigga
Brrt, brrt, brrt
You either win or lose
You either win or lose
You're not making this easy, Kyle
You either win or lose, it ain't no ties in life
(It's either a dub or a L on that record)
[Verse 1]
Perfect this, perfect that, yeah, the timin' right
Tried to keep me in the dark, now I'm shinin' bright
Opper could be same height as me, we ain't eye-to-eye
If the convo ain't about no profit, then it's "Hi," and "Bye"
Shit,
konnichiwa, sayonara
Feel like Sosa in some Louis loafers
, you can't find in Zara (Woo)
Pour a five and double back like I'm Garza
Out here every day, I'm just tryna hide from karma
So many skits pulls, so many juugs bust'
Inhale, exhale, for pain I got a wood stuffed
Drew the game plan, strapped my nuts on and got to it
Shit (Brrt), that's the best thing I ever did
And to my people's, shit I wish I was a better kid (Hmm)
But I guess it all worked out
Went through tribulations in the deep, you took the surf route
First round knockout, the clerk can't take a punch
Pullin' down, powered up, get yo' cables cut
Shit, I wake up needin' syrup, not the maple stuff (Ha)
BBs
gave me frostbite, got my nasals stuffed
Everyone who talked down, got passed up
Terabytin' like a car with a flat, I'm jacked up (Woo)
Olympic tennis team, gold on, we racked up (Woo)
The cut so designer, fiend can't tell it's smacked up
Shit, it's time to act up, five Ms, match what?
Bin Reaper, I can see your soul in these black buffs
I'ma standout and I ain't even gotta stand up
Every show, scrumble in the crowd, put yo' hands up (Yeah)
JuSleaze's jumpin' too (Brrt)
Vanilla buffs off the golden tints, dunkaroos
Eight hundred horses in the Shelby when I'm comin' through
Tell a bitch I'm one of one, that mean we ain't one and two
Sippin' purple full of scam, boy, you off some hundred proof
Eyes red, I'm in grind mode, I like my hundreds blue
Been had an attitude, I ain't just becomin' rude
Year 2000, sixth day in the month of June (Brrt)
Shit, that's when the G.O.A.T. was born (Brrt)
Every time I drop it's time to hear the goat perform (Yeah)
European tour, shit it's time to go explore (Yah)
You ain't never even left the city
Sold out show, times two, double set in Philly
