[Intro]
It's it, man
Different Breed the mixtape, man
I know y'all been waiting on this shit but I got to it
It's BabyTron in this bitch
Youngest nigga with a roll
Ha, yep
[Verse 1]
Turn around, turn around like a roundabout
Fuck you, bitch, where was you when I was down and out?
Yo bitch on the phone with you while I'm pounding out
After I hit, she on the side like she grinding out
Now let me show you what them thousands 'bout
Upping rolls on the 'Gram, you can count it out
I used to be broke but then a nigga found it out
These Margielas, baby girl, just try and sound it out
Good strips on me, she asked did I hit the Powerball
Nah, I just hit the road and came back with a twenty ball
Paid three for the shirt, that's a 'Gelo Ball
Two sticks on my hip like I'm Darth Maul
Hop in the whip and hit the road in a Nike fit
I got them pieces on me fucking up I-96
Dumb ho call me broke? I'll thrust on that grimy bitch
Scammed a lady out her house rent, on some slimy shit
