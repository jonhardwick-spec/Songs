[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
(
Damn, CR2, you made this?
)
[Verse 1: Kasher Quon]
I just poured up some Hi-Tech, that shit expired
If you got your ID and a card, you just got hired
I heard that nigga working at McDonald's, he just got fired
I'm tryna spark up a Backwood, where a Bic lighter?
[Verse 2: Shaudy Kash]
Trap star turned rap star
Pull up on the whole block, they like, "Who in that car?"
Fuckin' on your ho twat, walk in, back arched
Boy, you niggas too behind, must've got a bad start
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Whole gang wet as hell, we lookin' like some scuba divers
Only thing I punch is drip, bitch, we be shootin' fighters
Got a hundred gadgets in this whip, I'm the new MacGyver
Twenty racks on me, but I'm still finna use the slidеr
[Verse 4: Bankroll Reese]
Ayy, she like, "Why you take 'еm on a chase?" Bitch, this car go fast
Nigga think he finna slide this way, I be done parked your ass
7.62s, .308s, bro, your car won't last
No Jordan, ball like MJ, but I'll spark your ass
