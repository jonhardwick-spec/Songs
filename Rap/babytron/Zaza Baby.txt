[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Off the zotti, I don't do reggie
It's a Supercharger if you ever see me do hemi
Thirty in the stick, thirty milligrams in my body
Slammed off the Wocky, I might crash in the Masi'
Five-star 'telly, nodded off and crashed in the lobby
You think you slick, huh? We know them pants Abercrombie
Amiris with the rips like I just got attacked by zombies
I been hustlin' since forever, you can ask my auntie
Loaded my first strap at ten, you can ask my ahki
Might go surf and turf, it's been a while since I had hibachi
Skate around your block with a stick and a mask like hockey
[Verse 2: MJPAID]
Off-White X on my back, they think I'm a Nazi
Out in Cali, niggas hidin' from the paparazzi
Piece a bitch, still hittin' likе it's Ronda Rousey
Taj might up the blick when it's gеttin' crowded
[?][0:44] sixty inches, that ain't gettin' mounted
Talk about the coin every song, I ain't shit without it
Gotta get the [?], ain't no other options
[Verse 3: Fordio &
MJPAID
]
And I swear the Mastercards the only thing I'm coppin'
[?], he say he was far out in the mountains
Said fuck the L's, pros and lines only thing I'm countin'
Been off the [?] paint raw, got me feelin' drowsy
Done had a trip to experience this out-of-body
Tones don't feel like himself, he don't got pole by him
Been drinkin' since a kid, ain't never had a role model
Been sippin' Wocky, I ain't never touch Patrón bottle
Say she innocent, I'ma bring the ho out you
