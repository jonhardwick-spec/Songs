[Verse 1: Damjonboi]
Hm, yeah, I'm the last don
Put a nigga in a suit like he goin' to prom
Chances'll make champions, my nigga, you scared or somethin'?
Broke niggas tryna give advice, can't tell me nothin'
You was ballin', what, you tear your ACL or somethin'?
My young niggas got this bitch rockin', now crown 'em
Made it rain on my favorite stripper, had her drownin'
Fucked all the baddest bitches in the city you was houndin'
Niggas trippin' over runners, I ain't hit your bitch yet
Get a nigga whacked with a DistroKid check
Coach put you in the game, but you ain't got no fuckin' handles
Fuck a nigga bitch, then do an interview with Lando
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Told brodie, "Pour a deuce," he want a Xan' though
Firebomb his spot and turn his trap to a bando
You ain't еven half-blowed, you got a gram rolled
Don't еven ask if I got it on me, that shit Mando
Broke as hell but lit on the 'Gram, I can't stand hoes
Brodie let me drive it, told me, "Manifest the Lambo'"
It's two rules, stay up out the way and stack pros
Rhude head to toe, it's only right, 'cause I'm an asshole
If she a ten, I put the cam on her
If you say somethin', all ten, you gotta stand on it
If you tryna make bands off it, take a chance on it
If the lane green with the scams, I'ma spam on it
