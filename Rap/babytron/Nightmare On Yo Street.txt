Nyah
Nyah, nyah
Huh, huh
[Verse]
All that playin' with his life, might as well meet me at the graveyard
Built like a semi, but it's drivin' like a race car
Push the button, leave him underneath just like a spacebar
Pop up in yo' dreams, it's a nightmare on yo' street
If you touch one of mine, it's gon' be a nightmare for some weeks
Pull up to the zombie zone, it's a nightmare on the east
Sitting court side at Little Caesar's, Icewear next to me
Fuck my ex, I'm onto finer things
I got the torch, have you ever seen a fire freeze?
Slide through, you hear, "Fah, fah," that's a tire screech
Ho changed her life, I guess that makes her a retired freak
Even when I sleep in, I be tired of y'all
I'll ride by myself 'fore I slide with y'all
I'd do my own drugs 'fore I get high with y'all
I'd catch a private jet 'fore I fly with y'all
Two bust watch on, I still ain't got time for y'all
Whole case of red, but I still ain't got a line for y'all
All this fuckin' money that I got, ain't got a dime for y'all, still
Make sure it's double closed, I can't let the sauce spill
R.I.P. $cam, rode past Puritan and caught chills
You would think that cuddy down the way with food, it's all pills
You can't fuck with me and Certi', have you seen y'all grill?
Jigga got me feelin' like I'm rolling down a tall hill
I don't think I'm sleepin' tonight
To be exact, matter fact, I think I'm creepin' tonight
Ride around with two chops like I'm eatin' some rice
He ain't waitin' for the moon 'cause the beast in the light
Just know when I cook food, I put my feet in it twice
Twenty-three with several mill', don't think I need the advice
Lil' bro been expelled, but he read and he write
Bring me 'xotic, bring me drank, I need a P and a pint
You can call me Drankenstein, I keep a three in my Sprite
Nah, for real, I take my pop and then I bring it to life
This a fuckin' gun fight, why you bringin' a knife?
On tour, seein' sights that you ain't seen in yo' life
Rappin' 'bout designer, but I seen him leavin' from Snipes
He gettin' racks with some rats, we uppin' cheese with some mice
In a chase with DPD, I used to speed on a bike
You ain't never, never got nothin' free off a swipe
It's gettin' scary, at the spot, we slappin' Jack-O-Lanterns
Tryna move it by the bowl, but smokin', that's a trappin' hazard
Unky get some girl and flip it, watch him acrobat her
That was just a skit with Supa Hot, I'm not a battle rapper
I just got caught by my main, she found a Magnum wrapper
Tryna do the dash off shroomies, accidentally flashed the hazards
All that muggin', keep it to yourself 'cause we harass harassers
Wake up eatin' lamb, young Tron, he was a Apple Jacker
