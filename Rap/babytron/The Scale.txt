[Chorus: Flight]
Broke, broke the scaleBroke the scaleBroke the scaleBitch, I broke the scaleBroke the scaleBroke the scaleBroke the scaleBitch, I broke the scale
[Verse 1: Flight]
Top five but I'm really Top G
I ain't ever met a ho I couldn't link
Say that I'm target? Okay, I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't ever lost a ho that I wanted to keep, ayy
Running through a hunnid bands in a week
Florida baby, you can hear the accent when I speak
Was just a jit while other jits looking for freaks
Playing chicks, wasn't playing hidе and seek, ayy
Top five, you can apply that to whatever
Shе want forever, I'm too focused on the bezels
Cars need a Visa, flowing in, it's all pressure
Flying to LA, got like four, five gas pedals
Shade Room cool but I'm tryna make the Forbes
Switching Travis out for some Tom Fords
You can get a "Hey" out my bitch, she all yours
Man, she a trip, I ain't talking Bora Bora, ayy
6'3" but my money sitting taller
Looks fade, baby, what else can you offer?
Call up Brittany Renner, only fucking with the ballers
No NBA but Steph Curry in the pockets
That pussy warm, I just call it "Hot Pocket"
Out in Houston walking 'round with the Rockets
Like you volunteering, his pockets are non-profit
Knew I was gonna be that nigga, I ain't need a
profit
, ayy
