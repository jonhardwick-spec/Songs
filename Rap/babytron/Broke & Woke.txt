[Intro]
(
RJ always trippin', man, RJ always trippin', man
)
If it's crunch time, five seconds left on the clock
Is niggas gon' pass you the ball?
Talk to these niggas, Scrum
Let's get it
(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
[Verse 1: ScrumbleMan]
Moonrock got me high as hell, I think I'm finna float
Game time, game-winning shot, I ain't finna choke
Winter coming, think I'm finna put a dub up in my coat
If your bitch keep eyeing, I'ma put my dick up in her throat
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
It's crunch time, is you gon' shoot the three or you gon' stand and choke?
The game had me backed down in a corner, but I used the ropes
I got a bad bitch, ass pokin' out like some Dayton spokes
These smart-ass niggas got no cheese, these niggas broke and woke
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Rеal trench baby, I can take you wherе they shootin' dope
Flyin' by in somethin' they ain't seen, I'm a shootin' star
I'll pull up in that sleeve like a shooting guard
They ain't ankle-biters, but my dogs chase you through the yard
