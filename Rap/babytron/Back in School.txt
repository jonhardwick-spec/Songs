Enrgy made this one

[Verse 1: YSR Gramz]
Gettin' rap money and trap money, I can't stop trappin'
I can't wait 'til the summertime to catch my favorite opp lackin'
Catch a nigga at a green light and stop traffic
You be givin' freak hoes your money, niggas livin' backwards
Before I had a bank, I hid it in my mattress
Seventeen hundred for a fuckin' jacket
I wasn't born in Chiraq, but I ain't never lackin'
You was broke all year until you got your taxes
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Huh
Ever been blowed, scammin' on the phone and forgot your accent?
The beef all fun and games 'til they drop your casket
Lil' cuddy slimy, he'll ask like, "Let me rock your glasses"
Don't get your buffs snatched
Back in school, you was cryin' for your lunch back
Back in school, you got beat up and ain't punch back
Shе been a ho since a baby, that's a Rugrat
Made 'em throw thе towel in, was lookin' like a bloodbath
[Verse 3: YSR Gramz]
I'm in Beecher, out here boolin', where the bloods at?
Got the 40 in the club, this bitch compact
I went to school with a K in my backpack
Bro said they like that Scat Pack, they finna carjack it
I was trappin' in the fuckin' wintertime, I had a Carhartt hat
Two clips taped to the gun like a Pop-Tart pack
I got a ten-milli' for you big niggas just like Shaq
She gon' let me fuck on her for free, you gotta buy her cat
