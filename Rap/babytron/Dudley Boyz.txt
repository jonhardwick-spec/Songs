[Intro: TrDee]
(
Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby
)
Shh
Keep it going
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Big stepping, been popping
It ain't many like me, told her I'm her best option
Who you repping? What you rocking?
I don't gotta score, I'll pass like I'm Stockton
I don't really think these niggas hear me, let me crank the knob
Why the fuck you jumped off the porch and then go back inside?
You can't even hop in my whip if you ain't down to ride
How the fuck you even call it beef when you just go and hide?
I don't get it, boy
He really rapping, what you seen, you don't live it, boy
I remember Christmas really came and I ain't get a toy
It really rainеd on my parade, I'm kinda scared of joy
Don't expеct shit and I bet nobody let you down
I really took a couple L's and I ain't even frown
He said that he was pulling up then ended in a gown
If the feds pick you up, you bet' not make a sound
I ain't tryna beef, I'm tryna add some money to the stash (Stack it up, stack it up, okay)
We can both go and blow a bag, it ain't no going half (Nah, nah, yeah, okay, yeah, okay)
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Fly as hell on the plane, bitch, I'm double up
Good Wocky slush, taking sips out a double cup
Drac' bust once or twice, no, I don't knuckle up
Eighteen hunnid dollar 'Miri jeans, these bitches hug my nuts
Fourth quarter, last shot, just know I'm clutching up
You broke as fuck, that's why yo bitch always huff and puff
Talking 'bout beef? Lil' boy, you ain't tough enough
Bitch got her first thousand bucks, must be stuffing drugs
Told TrDee tag me in, we the Dudley Boyz
Stop talking 'bout dimepieces, yo bitch ugly, boy
If you fall off, better pray you have bungees, boy
Hopping out the whip, run up on him, "Where my money, boy?"
Huh, you must wanna die
B22 Dior sneaks, I don't want 'em tied
Heard a couple punchlines from dawg, every one a lie
Backdoor season, bust yo head if you run in mines
They hating on us and I wonder why
Chill guy, owe me pape' though? You'll see my other side
Skinny jeans full of dog shit, they made by Number (N)ine
It's May and I'ma stack a new hunnid 'fore the summertime
