Lyrics from Snippet
[Verse]
Used to have to look up through the window, now I shop wherever
'Round trip to Cali, fly it back, I'm out here copin' pressure
Soon as he come around, there go my cop detector
Two hoes, they finna give me top, let's see who bop it better
Why he always hidin' in the crib? He must got a tether
Let his granny walk up out his shit, we tryna drop whoever
Shit, we'll pop his grand daddy
Fifty bands got my skinny Ksubi pants saggin'
[?]
[?] ridin' 'round with so many straps (Brrt)
Scat Pack take that Henny Pack (Skrrt)
I bought the kitty blowin' heavy threat (Whew)
Automatic weapons, you will never hear a semi-rad (Brrt)
Why you tryna sell me that? Boy, that's some Reggie Pack
You need yo ass beat
If I'm in the booth [?]
Bitch paid when I was half sleep
I need to put the cup down, I caught a cavity
Three, three-five of shit, fuck, damn, I lost my gravity
You gotta be a worker, none of boss is mad at me
Six figures workin' on the 7th, think we talkin' salary
King of the galaxy, you can call me Majesty
Wreck the 'hawk and turn it to a striker, it's gonna be a casualty
[?], gonna be a masterpiece
Hundred dollar eighthy in the booth, smokin' rapper weed
Why you in here hatin', cut it with the capery
Habibi pull up with his sword, he ridin’ with the calvary
He just dropped some trash can, man, that album weak
Popped the hood and seen some Hennessy, I might crash the jeep
Cut the traction, watch the whip yank
He shoulda’ got it tinted, caught him ridin' fish-tank
Big body off wocky, switch lanes while I sip drank
