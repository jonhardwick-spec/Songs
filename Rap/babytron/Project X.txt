[Verse 1: TrDee]
Play your cards right
I put on my new chain, it gave me a frost bite
I put some niggas on, guess that was the boss in me
That bitch kind of bad, but she kinda walk funny
I kind of dislike these niggas music, shit weak
And what you niggas wearing, I drift, this shit cheap
That bitch'd probably come back tomorrow, it's not deep
I thought you had my back, but you dim and I peeped
I've been peeping vibes, keep yours unless it's good
I can't go to bed until I roll me up a 'Wood
We ain't gotta speak but I'ma hope you always good
He wanna join the gang, told him go rob the plug
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Counting up my blessings, bitch, I'm fortunate
Could play ARP or sting him with the scorpion
Make it disappear, your bitch a sorceress
Olympian, run 'em down with fire, bitch, I'm torching shit
Semis, fullies, Remingtons, we got morе shots than Hooters do
Barking like he bitе, I'm quick to have them killers neuter you
Say it's up with us? I'm hopin' doggy got a super-suit
Tripping in a Subaru, lil' bro and them be super through
I had Cuddy spot up on his block, you know them hoopers shoot
Your bitch say this Marni x Amiri make her cooter ooze
She think I'm the hottest out but I just play it super cool
If I call Militia, ain't no telling what my troopers do
