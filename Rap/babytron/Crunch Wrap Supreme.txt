[Chorus: BabyTron]
Up a fist and get yo ho-ass smacked
Or Skilla'll put the beat on you,
CoCash Black
Throw a skully on, boy, we know that’s cap
That ain't a boner, bitch, that's a whole-ass rack
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Ayy, let him stand ten, bro’ll knock the heart out him
Chop do him shitty, probably knock a fart out him
Seen them M's coming so I'm feeling part profit
Got a Bon Jovi Visa on me so the card rocking
[Verse 2: Skilla Baby]
Huh
I got high and transformed like a Megatron
I might dunk on Boban if I stand on Tron
Who that bitch hear me ghost? Might be Cardi
I know my teacher shitty, boy, I'm TrDee
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Teacher used to hate me, I was tardy
My new bitch exclusive, she a Barbie
She don't get shit for Christmas 'cause she naughty
I know the drawers dropping if I pull up in a Audi
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Triple S, let me found out you rocking FUBU
Somewhere in yo bitch throat while I'm watching Hulu
Surfing in this foreign bitch, she from Honolulu
Sticked up in that field, feel like Shaka Zulu
