[Intro: StanWill]
Yeah, huh, ayy
Yeah, five hunnid (
It's Bluestrip, baby
)
Yeah, ayy, five hunnid
Yeah
Five hunnid dollars for a
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Five hunnid dollars every step, bitch, my feet lavish
Two hunnid dollars every plate, bitch, I eat lavish
I'm in Walmart like voilà, bitch, this piece magic
Skrrt-skrrt when I'm in the Chally like I ballet dance
Drop a fluke check, I might fuck around and grab eight bands
Designer head wraps, twenty K's, we from Pakistan
Scam dancing, might scuff the Diors when I catch a ham
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
You can hear the wasp buzzing on it when the Scatty drift
Deep in that one mode, lil' bitch, the baggy zipped
Applе tightened up, grab ten 'forе they patch the glitch
Stop with that fake Fraud Bible, that shit blasphemous
Bounty on his head, we gon' treat it like it's Warzone
Up top, give him hangtime like some cornrows
I don't need the key, BNB with the door code
Two profiles with insurance, I got four phones
