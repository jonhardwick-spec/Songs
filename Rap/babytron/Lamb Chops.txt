[Verse 1: TrDee]
Ayy, you can't even pull my card, I ain’t got one
[?] yeah, we got one
Nigga, I don't got a heart but I'll rob one
Super [?] for a play, yeah, I’ll spot one
Hood on, scam season, bitch, I'm activated
Boy, the only time you bussing, when you masturbating
She my bitch but not my bitch, it's kinda complicated
Seen these niggas wear the same fits like they animated
I ain't pop a Perc but I fuck her like I did
I ain't get the neck but I really wish I did
She all in my ear, talking 'bout she want my kid
These niggas all cap, starting to think they work at Lids
I'm starting to hear a lot about chip readers and scamming
No, I'm not feeling music when I say I’m jamming
Me and bro both sending bullets like the Mannings
I’ma call this BIN "Batista Bomb" 'cause this bitch slaming
[Hook: TrDee]
Mad at the chef, where my lamb chops?
Where my slatts that was Thugger from the sand box?
Shut up, bitch, sit and watch that mail box
I was getting head, dozing off watching Boondocks
