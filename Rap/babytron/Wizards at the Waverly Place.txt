[Intro: TrDee]
(
Thank you, GC

How I'm feelin', swanton-bombin'
[Verse 1: TrDee]
How I'm feelin', swanton-bombin' off a jet
I know niggas better get some time to come collect
I heard you be usin' teeth, so I don't want your neck
You don't think that we gon' win, well, come and place your bet
You can't see me 'cause it's curtains on the Maybach Sprinter
We gon' fry him like some chicken, he be actin' tender
I feel like I won the 'ship, lil' bitch, you with a winner
We all ball on hall of fame and you just a beginner
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Chopper with me, I can't ride with just a pistol
Doggy whole 'fit from Temu, don't even look official
M's in my bank account, you see 'em when you cook McGriddles
Shit, when push comes to shove, you gotta mush a little
Lil' bro don't stop spinnin' like a conveyor belt
Ain't had nothin' in a minute, them boys need major help
Somehow, I'm the one who always get it, told her blame herself
.308'll smack the side his striker, watch his Shaker melt
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Chopstick got kick, shit just like Buttowski
Touchdown, Mike Vick, white buffs like Ronda Rousey
Finna take me a trip, just got a bag from Ghazi
Y'all niggas ain't on shit, tell me who done caught a body
If you try me, bro, I swear this shit get catastrophic
You ain't got no whip, so I can't catch you out in traffic
I'ma hit you with these clips since you be always out here actin'
You can't put no bitch on me, you know that's a shitty tactic
