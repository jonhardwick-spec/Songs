This bitch punani, on tsunami
Bought my bitch a new body, my hitter got a few bodies
Shotgun got two shawties hanging out the roof probably
Ridin' in a striker but my wrist a Bugatti
When they said it's smoke, we pulled up, blew an opp in blue zotti
Hit him in his top because he started acting too rowdy
Whole pint of juice and you can't even get a deuce out me
Pull up thousand horses on your bitch and tell your boo howdy
Pull up on your block like I play center
Had to put the Perkies down, them hoes be fucking with my temper
How high I was, I can't remember
Say hе in that water, but be ducking all my swimmers
Shе like, "Who you with?" Lil' bitch, you know I'm with the shitters
You better keep your ho tucked 'cause my bro and them some rizzards
Off my wrist I got pneumonia, off my neck I got the shivers
You can't get no pussy, you be always up on Tinder
Dodgin' Warren and Hazel Park, I'm fucking up Dequindre
Dog Shit Militia, catch me marching with my members
Talking 'bout you balling, boy, you just a Derek Fisher
With my twin, how ironic, we just hit a pair of sisters
I can slap a dick up on this bitch and switch the gender
I can't even tuck it 'cause this bitch stuffed with a fifty-ball
Feeling like I'm Certi', ridin' 'round with a sixty-ball
True to my religion, might hit Hutch and drop a pissy cross
All these fucking sticks but ain't nobody in here playing golf
You the type to buy it, I'm the one creates the sauce
He just yapping, everything that doggy say is talk
Told my baby grab it, it don't even matter what it cost
Fah, fah, fah they gotta chalk it, it's a fucking loss
You niggas cheesier than pizza with no fucking sauce
You don't even own shit, don't call yourself a boss
Being up, being down, and in between, I felt it all
Fuck a break pedal, full throttle, I ain't letting off
Plug pulled up with a pint, they cracked the seal just like a freak
Ropes to the Cubans, oh my God, I skipped the diamond links
I can never find the opps, them niggas great at hide and seek
Caught him tryna backdoor me, so I'm cripping on the blink
