[Intro: TrDee]
LV umbrella for the rainy days
[Verse 1: TrDee]
LV umbrella for the rainy days
Whole team shining 'cause our diamonds look like lemonade
I'm married to the money, we won't separate
Only want the chips, only worried 'bout my Better Made
Mind on the mill', please don't ask me where no bitches at
Treat her like a car, she backed it up and let me get in that
Heard y'all niggas broke, I hate to say it ain't no fixing that
In they backdoor, I had to make sure mines was still intact
I'm still 42'ing Casamigos but I'm passed drunk
Money ain't gon' fall in yo lap, get yo ass up
Boo, my life boring, only thing I do is paper chase
ShittyBoyz for life, boy, this shit just like a figure eight
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Glock with the flash, I pull up shooting like I'm TMZ
Ugly than a bitch, think pape' the only thing she see in me
My babies came up off punching, bitch, we TMT
Shirt double G but the sneaks, they say "D&G"
In the trenches right now but the trucks suburban
We them niggas that the hoes tryna fuck for Birkins
Cut into her for that head, I don't fuck with flirting
Thinkin you gon' rob them? .223s, they'll touch yo turban
Feel like Groot, in the spaceship sticked up
Every whip fast, tell the boys they can't flick us
If I'm with her, gotta know I got my dick sucked
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, boy, that's big thrusts
