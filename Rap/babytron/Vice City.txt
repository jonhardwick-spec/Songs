[Intro: G.T.]
Yeah, ayy
Ayy, yeah
[Verse 1: G.T.]
He got the mink on, same color [?]
My OG a real nigga, they hit him with the Rico
Bitch, I'm the chosen one, I feel like Zion
I'm with my young nigga, what up, BabyTron?
This dirty [?] free my nigga Juan
It's only right a nigga pass the baton
Smoking pink Runtz, chasing it with Lemon Loud
I'ma run through a hundred [?] bro gon' do the [?]
I done watch bro punch up a thousand times
I done heard rappers make up a bunch of lies
I been up and down seventy-five thousand times
Seventy-five racks on me, tryna make it fit inside
Dior off Amiri, do that anytime
Got play acting like he know me but I'm really slime
Blues or the oranges, wе been [?]
Bro, we got this shit tapped up like wе in the [?]
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Come to jugg school, you can make some cheese faster
Tip-toeing in the bank like the Pink Panther
Wouldn't give a bitch a ring if I was Green Lantern
Threw a blue strip at the waiter, bitch, I need manners
Ran a check up and made yo bitch rub my feet after
I'm just playing, bro, yo bitch doesn't meet standards
Feel like John Cena with it, boy, this piece slamming
I'ma fuck around and get indicted if I keep jamming
You're a Colin Kaepernick, go ahead and take a knee
I'm really making cheese, this ain't make believe
I could be a free agent, wouldn't change my team
I'ma send his spirit to the sky if I aim this beam
Hoes on my dick, where was y'all when I needed you?
Pull up on tip, the EMS gon' leave with you
It's summertime and I still keep a sleeve or two
The puzzle ain't complete till I use this last piece or two
Man, why won't this chip scan?
Could've went to U of M but I'd rather chip jam
NBA street game breaker, boy, this BIN slam
Walk around punching everything, feel like Ip Man
Feeling like DeRozan, I just stuffed a light ten
Rather work magic with the fraud, fuck Skyrim
Looking like a UFO when I fly in
Had the reader in the locker room, I ain't like gym
