[Intro]
"My father was a drinker and a fiend. One night he goes off crazier than usual. He turns to me and he says, 'Why so serious?'"
(
Stupid Dog, I ain't gon' lie, this bitch hard
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Voice kinda raspy, off a eighth of Runtz and deuce of Wock'
Mister Get It In, I'll probably make a dub by two o'clock
Told the Somerset Gucci I need all the shoes and socks
Feeling Japanese, when it's beef, I gotta use the chop
Lying 'bout what's in yo coffee cup, that's a ice cap
Fuck a pair of buffs, brodie sliding, tryna life snatch
He was off the drugs, took his kit, that's a hijack
Heavy load, ran it up so quick, I need a ice pack
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Sick as hell we still balling, living like
The Flu Game
Dog Shit Militia, sorry, I don't carry loose changе
Told her bring her friends and shе pulled up with a D Wade
Three-piece, let him figure out who giving who brain
Stack it if I fall, I know Benji gon' come pick me up
Talking 'bout her ex? I told that bitch I do not give a fuck
On a different mission, on my mind is just to run it up
Feel like Scissorhands from the way I'm always cutting up
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Feel like switching hands, paint stepping like I'm Mike Jordan
Seen an opp and beat him, could've killed him, that's just light horsage
Talking 'bout I'm up a hunnid? Better times four it
Forgiatos, on that fast thang, I only ride foreigns
Bro got the Gucci belt, he got some bodies under it
If I'm in the club, bitch, it's probably thundering
Unky spot up on that corner shooting, Robert Covington
High as hell, taking puffs, sipping Wocky, hovering
