3 piece
[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, huh-huh, huuuh
Huh, huh, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, tsk, ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
At a loft on the top floor
Oh yo lil' girlfriend? Hmm, she’s my top whore
Can you put that money up, boy it is not yours
Tsk, and not that gun, it is not yours
Like I said, that lil' bitch, she is not yours
I be shootin' shot with bitches that’ll block yours
Oh it's up? And it's on the floor
Fucked that lil' bitch from the back and make her touch her toes
[Verse 2: Jaysmoove]
Jay, Stan and Tron, that's a 3 Piece
Shoes on my feet, never seen a crease
We on the floor, baby, get up out them sheets
In the field makin' plays, I ain't talkin' cleats (Scam)
She said come through, man I just might
Bitch getting clingy, hit her last night
When I see that shit deposit, it’s a good sight
I been runnin’ up a sack, Reggie White
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Put a hole in ‘еm, turn a opp to a cheerio
Good chop got kick like Ray Mysterio
She ain't wanna fuck ‘til I thrеw the ‘Miri’s on
Yeah I got thrust and that's something that you clearly don't
Yeah, lyin' in his raps he a kneecapper
Yo bitch wanna fuck, Imma meat sack her
Hit a opp up top, he gon’ meet Casper
Actin' bad in the ‘Cat, I'm a street thrasher
