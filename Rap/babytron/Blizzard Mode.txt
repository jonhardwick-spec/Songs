[Intro: StanWill]
Can't break, I was, yeah
Yeah
[Verse 1: StanWill,

Huh, can't break, I was made for this
You gon' go broke keeping up, better save that shit
On fully, I might spray some shit if they say some shit
I chase bank daily, why the fuck would I chase a bitch?
I won't chase a bitch, I won't love a ho
Paparazzi flashing, I might, fuck it, finna up the roll
On the seven sticked up, feel like double-O
If she snap a pic in my whip, I'ma fuck for sure
Shooter hanging out the window, boy, you better tuck and duck
If yo baby pulling up on gang, she gon' suck and fuck
Really worked for everything we got, wasn't nothing luck
Euro stepping off the Ksubi jeans, bitch, I'm thrusted up
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Made her go in Sprint off the Pro, I ain't hump the slut
Once it's on the floor, it's there forever, boy, it's up and stuck
They used to talk down then, now we coming up
Keep a couple straps on my ass like I bungee jump
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Stan sending bullets like he Justin Herbert
Really always let these hoes be, never been a lurker
Only got the head, boy, I promise that I didn't fuck her
AR got more kick than that nigga P. J. Tucker
