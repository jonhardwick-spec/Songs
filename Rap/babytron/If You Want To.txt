Huh, like shit, it's what you won't do

[Verse 1]
I was fourteen bustin' scams off the i4
Bro ain't got no heart, but keep metal, he a cyborg
When you bust for a quick twenty, you want five moreShit, or like six, seven, eight, or like nine more
Ten times ten, I'm a hundred, I'm like up three
MC scammer, I'll be damned to let you touch me
Chanels too new, I'll be damned to let you scuff these
Your bitch on dick but I'll be damned to let her fuck me
Yeah, I'm bougie, picky eater, ain't no veggies in my rice
Spot up like Durant, yeah, bitch, I'm steady with the right
Tell her what you want,
we gon' be forever if you right
You won't be able to fuck with me like never in your life
I don't think you'll touch a hundred K like ever in your life
Unky on his way back, he cut his tether with a knife
When you make real money, you'll drop whatever in a Sprite
Off-White 1's like I spend whatever on the Mikes
But I don't, I punch 'em
Twenty pair of Yeezys, we'll fuck around and stomp 'em
Orange Joker stash, I might fuck around and dump 'em
Aston with that two-oh run, it was somethin'
Once upon a time, I was down and they laughed at me
Now it's 2020 RTs when we drag Scatty
Skinny jeans on like Squidward, I don't cat daddy
Five-twelves got my teeth shine, I'm so jack happy
