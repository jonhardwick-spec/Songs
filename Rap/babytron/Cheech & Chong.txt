Real money, come on
Yeah
[Verse 1: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
This real money, it ain't gon' cost to get you bagged up
I'm in the spaceship, the only reason that we ain't flyin' 'cause I'm backin' up
Bro in the 'Cat, he hit the gas and fucked the streets up
She gave me neck, I put her out and threw my peace up
I'm right back to the hood, the money callin', this my money phone
These hoes love a rich nigga until his money gone
I like when that money counter goin' nuts, that's my favorite song
I'm just thumbin' through them hundreds tryna sing along
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Me and brodie facin' eighths, we look like Cheech and Chong
LooseLeafs and Slapwoods, y'all can keep the bongs
Make a bitch talk to the hand like she readin' palms
Fuck a wintertime grind, this hustle four seasons long
All these puppies in the kitchen, you would think we breedin' dog
Should I put the smackdown on it? Should I leave it raw?
Feel like I done heard everything, I done seen it all
Second that I bust a nut the moment that I peep her flaws
