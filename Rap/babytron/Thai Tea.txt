[Verse 1: J1Hunnit]
I got my head in the game, Troy Bolton
I hope you ain't think I was hot then, now I'm molten
Lava oozing out a nigga cup, Mauna Loa
I still'll serve a fiend the hard hit, the Balboa
Where was niggas at when we used to share Samoas?
And trade polos for the day and give them back when school was over
Baby wanna tan for the summer and drink mimosas
Out in Africa, we trying fufu and beef samosas
I think I'm starting to understand Tony and Sosa
It could've played out either way, but shit went how it was supposed to
Shit ain't always sunny, Maureen Ponderosa
My señorita skin tone the samе color as tapioca
Mi chica [?] centavo, mi amosa
She thick as grits, this bitch cold as Minnesota
I can't lеt a kid hit my cup, it's spiked soda
I met a plug from the Florida Keys with good coca
He told me when the time right, that we can meet in Sarasota
These days, you gotta pack heat, Erik Spoelstra
Brodie had hoop dreams until the league fucked him over
Now he playing overseas, getting a check in Nova Scotia
When life do a lil' flip, that don't mean it's game over
We going on a trip, that's they want that shit in North Dakota
I would take the 'Hound, but I'm stuffin' a Toyota
With a case of Thai tea in the back, but not boba
