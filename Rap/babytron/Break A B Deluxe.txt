[Verse 1: BandGang Javar]
This cold bitch just slid in my DM's like "What you doin', boo?"
Ice Gucci on me all the time, yeah, I remember you
She double backin' 'cause I got more chicken than a petting zoo
I ain't gon' be petty, I'ma treat you like my other two
I fucked then hit her with that "What you bout to get into?"
I ain't heartless, when them skims drop, she got a few
And I ain't stupid, when them fours drop, she got approved
And I ain't greedy off that 5K, I gave her two
Bitch, toot your face on this ID, I don't want nude pics
Twenty pros, forty common names, you gon' make ten quick
I can make a bitch or I can break a bitch
Long as I get paid, I don't care who she fuck with
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Said that you know how to break a brick, just save it for the birds
Place a bounty by the second, bro gon' take it by the third
(Fuck around and die the next day, no hat
No fakin', ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia)
Told Javar to just deluxe the song, I had to hit the road
Sixty days, fifty shows, somewhere in your city blowed
Fuck around and stack six hundred jacks up off of fifty pros
Cuddy in the kitchen dog fetchin', but ain't frisbee throw
BandGang, ShittyBoyz, that's always a classic
Yeah, I grew up in the jungle, but, man, I always adapted
Bad as hell in school, but I always was absent
Turned out for the pape', the blue strips, they always attractive
Shut the fuck up, you ain't been on shit since you was born
I wear palm trees acid, you know me, yeah, I'ma do the foreign
Syracuse vibes, in New York we got the blues and oranges
Balenciaga, paid a fuckin' rack, that's why the shoes enormous
Every L I've seen, it was a lesson, all I know is triumph
All I know is victory, all I know is trophies
All I eat is hundred dollar meals, like all you know is Coney
Must be fucked up in the city, must be fucked up rubbin' pennies
If it ain't a supercharger in front of it, won't touch the Hemi
If it ain't a fully switch up on it, I won't touch the semi
I be sippin' Quagen in the Wocky, I can't touch the Remi
