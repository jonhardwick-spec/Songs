[Verse]
I hope y'all really on that 'cause we on that
You better use yo head 'fore we put it where the floor at
Feel like Santa Claus dragging bags, where the hoes at?
I'm a scammer, dawg, I do fraud, you should know that
Thirty ball on me fucking up the way I walk
Puff this, puff that, fucking up the way I talk
Yeah, yo bitch kinda cute but once I fuck her, get her off
How they life get real when I start fucking with the fraud?
She ask for my name, I told her "Tron", not the real shit
Bitch said she real like, yeah, bitch, real hit
You gotta be a handicap fucker, you don't feel this
Bro ain't touch the ball since mighty mites and he'll still blitz
I don't really like to fight with
rights
, the blicky on me does
Living life so right, I could up a fifty or a dub
You're returning bottles, I'm out of town getting in the tub
I ain't wanna rap but
[?]
is really I'm the one
Backwoods, crack juggs, my baddest bitch act good
AR got a frying pan attached, get yo ass cooked
Throw a hook? I wish yo ass would
What I spent on the kicks, I could've bought a damn foot
SB, man, this shit forever like life and death
She think I like her neck, real life, ain't got time for sex
2021, I'm touching down in a private jet
2021, the lake house with the private deck
2022, Pacific time in a submarine
Looking in the mirror like, shit, he look like the plug to me
I don't chase chicks, my old hoes always come to me
And stop thinking that you my bitch 'cause you fucking me
Hoes lined up, give it up, boy, yo time's up
Fancy than a bitch, sipping Wocky out a wine cup
Y'all talk about my bangs, whole time y'all 'fros ain't lined up
Slam a bitch like I'm Roman Reigns and fuck her spine up
Dunking red in a cup, I'm feeling like a pelican
I'ma Jazzy Jeff her out the crib if she yell again
Louboutin's all white, red bottoms, peppermint
I think it's fucking glue on my hands, the bag, I'm catching it
Caught five thousand dollars, not playing jackpot
Steak five ounces, hunnid dollars, ain't no Black Rock
If you be real quiet in the trap, you'll hear the crack pot
I don't wanna see no ass, I just want some lamb chops
Stone Island on, I'm walking 'round this bitch like Geodude
Toss the BIN up to Dee, boy, that's a Visa-oop
Known to shoot the bag out but I can Greek Freak it too
Think I got a problem, spent thirty on Adidas shoes
Huh, shit, and the pants
Time is money, bitch, so I need paper in advance
Closet like Japan, Bathing Ape designer pants
Slide a hunnid giffies then I do my swiper dance
