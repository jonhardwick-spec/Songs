ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Good punch from LA, call it "Rajon"
Bro'll chase you down on that block like he Bron Bron
Site too fire, you can't get what BabyTron on
Run up on me? I'ma leave that nigga shaking like a pom-pom
Stupid-ass opps tryna munch then they dead
Glock so athletic, let it dunk on yo head
Dick too long, had her jumping off the bed
Fuck using cash, I'd rather punch, go and ask the fed
Fucking up a New York strip,
fuck a T-bone
Pussy too wet, this bitch squirting on my Vlone
Twenty-seven hunnid, just cashed out on three phones
Dead stock Yeezys, you'll probably cash 'em pre-owned
Sent my bitch in the store off a good debit
Lil' bro shooting, you gon' probably need a good medic
Pray to God that I meet a dumbass with good credit
Punch here and slide there, boy, I got a jugg fetish
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Bitch, I'm all on my cheese like a dentist be
Jimmy step in Christians like he had an administry
I just want the credit, give a fuck 'bout yo identity
Ham said the scam was a scam, she offending me
Man, just go get the phones then go leave
Bro say it's fuck you then you my enemy
Just got blew in the whip, feel like Kennedy
ShittyBoyz broke? Bitch, you fucked up mentally
Boy ain't seeing cheese like he lactose
Oh, that's yo bitch? Better lock up that back door
Fucked off the name, what the fuck I gotta cap for?
Feel like Pillsbury, got more rolls than a fat ho
Jumped in the deep end, bitch, I'm Hasselhoff
Bro said he got the torched tucked, he won't pass it off
He on tip, don't make them boys go and grab the chalk
Twenty-twenty vision and she still blew my glasses off
