Sneaking in a store with this 201 like Sly CooperPop up at yo crib with them ladders, looking like roofers
Walking out his crib the only time he ever saw a shooter
Shooter couldn't find a Glocky, fucked around and brought the ruger
Lil' bro be icing shit, it's like the opps done saw a jeweler
Internet thug, I'll pull up and take yo computer
Pull up? I'll make yo block hot, AR with the cooler
If I ain't send yo bitch in Sprint, you know I put some dick into her
Oversized Gucci trench coat, I look like Sherlock Holmes
Unc' a tweaker off the pills, he had to leave the Percs alone
Virgil did the tee, bitch, hold on, let me turn and pose
Ain't no talking, bitch, I'm busting quick, I turn my virgin on
Ritz cream soda with a three of red in it
Mike A-motherfucking-miris stuffed with dead niggas
Hate me but don't know me, I don't understand niggas
Think it's pape' on the way, why the fuck my hands itching?
[Bridge 1: BabyTron]
Hello?
Man, fuck on, you ain't got no damn money
Weird-ass
Ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 2: StanWill]
New bitches in my DM when I up pics, pop out in that one shit
2021, you know it's us if it's that one whip
Bought another Glock like I don't got enough sticks
Ride around the Mitten hot, boy, we on that fuck shit
She know she can't fuck with me 'cause all my bitches bad as hell
We be tripping up at Somerset, my niggas grabbing shelves
Lil' bro was zooming in them Scatties 'fore he had his L's
Once we heard that nigga died we was glad as hell
