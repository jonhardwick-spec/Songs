[Intro: The Godfather]
(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
Yeah
[Verse 1: The Godfather]
Yung Sak Runner, bitch, I stack hundreds
Wanna be a big dog, go and whack somethin'
I'm with BabyTron slidin', tryna smack somethin'
If you book me for a show, just know the strap comin'
Yeah, I'm on gang shit, 4Matic, lane switch
I've been with the same clique who fucked on your main bitch
Lips remain zipped, blow this bitch right off the hip
Show you how a boss'll get, gon' die just 'cause you talkin' shit
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
I can kill him off the drip
Bro code can't even turn me on, shit, I'm off this bitch (I'm gone)
Me and MJ on the 6, probably off a six
We've been heavy on the Wocky, I forgot that coughs exist (Ahh)
Marni bucket hat, I'm lookin' like I caught a fish (Reelin')
Paid for dinner, then she hoed you, you just bought a kiss (Lame)
Two thousand all slips on thе joggin' fit
Doggy thought that he was loadin' up until he saw the glitch
[Verse 3: YSR Gramz]
Yung Sak Runnеr
Broke as hell or rich as fuck, I'm still the same nigga
I ain't NBA YB, I hang with gravediggers
He wasn't loyal to the gang, we had to trade that nigga
How the fuck you get on and you ain't save your niggas?
He always cappin' in his raps, he wear all fitteds
Free Dee Rich, that nigga shoot like Cole Bennett
Fell in love with her head, she a soul stealer
I buy all my Percocets from old women
