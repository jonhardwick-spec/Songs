Nyah
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bought the jeans yesterday, but shit, the shoes newer (Ooh)
He up hundreds once a year, that boy a blue mooner (Lame)
Twenty hoes versus me, I ain't a YouTuber
When it come to L's, I bounce back, you a boo-hooer (Nyah)
You better warn the driver 'cause we shoot Ubers
Black trucks in Manhattan, we ain't never used scooters
Big ten milli with the glitchie, you a deuce-deucer
Zotti smellin' like a litterbox, like where's the poop scooper?
Spent sixty-six on this Cuban, Yasiel Puig
Actin' like the brick man, at most, you probably sell weed (Man)
If we got flicked right now, you'd probably tell on me
What I mean is if I pull over, it's probably felonies
How the fuck my shooter ain't on Billboard, all these hits he got?
He just met the juice man and cop, that's a risky pop
Went from rock bottom underground to the tippy top (Top)
Ball hog with the chop, I'm takin' sixty shots
[Verse 2: TrDee]
(Brrt, fah-fah, frrt)
Oh, you a funny guy (Oh)
What is that, a .7? Ain't no way you gettin' high
I be livin' like a pilot, every day I'm gettin' fly (Fly)
I be with the head tappers, we ain't shootin' in the sky
Real nigga comin' through, make some room
Tron in this bitch trippin', talkin' crazy off of shrooms (Shit)
You can't catch me in that bucket, push the pedal, it don't zoom
Gang and them just dropped a five, finna turn the Sprite maroon (Let's go)
I don't gangbang, SBDSM to the end (ShittyBoyz)
Really one of one like you might just get smacked, you call me twin
Really him, no, I'm not them, so, bitch, you better come correct (I'm him)
I'll pull up ballin' on you niggas, I don't have to stretch (Fuck, ballin')
I be standin' on business, please don't take it personal (Ha, ha)
Fuck I look like battle rappin' rappers? I ain't Arsonal (The fuck?)
Baby, I'ma keep it real with you, I ain't perfect, though (I'm not)
You be bitter hatin' on your own niggas on the low (For real?)
That shit weak (Damn)
