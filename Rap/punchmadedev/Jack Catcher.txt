Put a puncher jersey on my back im the MVP
I'm finna cop a bustdown now youI ain't have to bust no EDDs
I just swiped a mansion in the hills, now I'm on MTV
Equipped my Glock and nearly shot my bitch for tryna hit my weed
I bent the block and almost dropped a six tryna pour my lean
We Re-rock the wock we selled on the strip, I support my fiends
Catch the drop, stack it at the crib, hope the floor don't see
My mail bossx gon' really have me rich if the world don't see
I'm a Jack Catcher
Soon as I see you with that chain, imma snatch th'em letters (Yea)
I can move the bows through TSA `cos I pack it better
I might pass up on a percocet but a package never (never doing that)
In one week, I could run a hunnid thousand up
I'm lying, but on God I could run up twenty thousand bucks
We don't wanna hear your mixtape cu'cos the Ibars suck
I'm looking like a cool down in public iI got the chop tucked
Just seen my opps inside the mall and every one of y'all looked
I was dolo with my chains on and they never got took
You can't find a snitch in my circle, we'll never get booked
I'm Mr. Put It On, when iI pop out everybody gon' look
We some ghetto super stars
They keep asking if iI'm famous cu's I pulled up in a super car
I can do 280 in a Scat, this bitch super charged
Still stuck in the hood i, I know your childhood was super hard
At this rate, you gon' never make it out alive
How the fuck are you a grown ass man with no car to drive
I'm in Lex with my pole poking, I ain't hard to find
If he don't swipe cards or kill people he ain't one of mine
