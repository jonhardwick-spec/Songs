[Verse 1]
I don't wanna rap I wanna bust plays
I got a couple million to my name
I don't know why I'm rapping anyway
I can go dig up my safe right now, pull out a quarter million any day
You might as well send all your money to me, I was going to take it anyway
Reach for that bitch I guarantee you die
Nobody ever took a chain from me, I show it every day
when I'm on live
I promise you're nowhere close to being me, you don't even have a car that you can drive
I know I'm going down in history, because I be torching shit when I'm online
Y'all favorite rappers running out of money, I got proof right here
He going out sad this shit starting to get ugly
I know what I'm doing ain't right, this shit bad but I can't lie likе I truly don't love it
4 million dollars made that in a year, but I got somе M's that I still ain't touch yet
You can't name a bank that I still ain't touched yet
[Chorus]
I don't wanna rap I wanna bust plays
I got a couple million to my name
I don't know why I'm rapping anyway
I can go dig up my safe right now, pull out a quarter million any day
You might as well send all your money to me, I was going to take it anyway
[Verse 2]
Reach for that bitch I guarantee you die
Nobody ever took a chain from me, I show it every day when I'm on live
I promise you're nowhere close to being me, you don't even have a car that you can drive
I know I'm going down in history, because I be torching shit when I'm online
Y'all favorite rappers running out of money, I got proof right here
He going out sad this shit starting to get ugly
I know what I'm doing ain't right, this shit bad but I can't lie like
I truly don't love it
4 million dollars made that in a year, but I got some M's that I still ain't touch yet
You can't name a bank that I still ain't touched yet
