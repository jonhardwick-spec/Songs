[Hook]
Why this lil bitch keep looking through my phone with her messy ass
I got caught fucking with the hoes and she kept my ass
These niggas tryna beef with me but I'm too deep inside my bag
Pulled up with a ruler clip but I ain't plan to show up to a class
New scat do 200 I might fuck around and do the dash
I be posted outside everyday they can't be on my ass
I'm superstar in my city you can check the stats
The neighbors want to kick us out cause we be blowing too much gas
[Verse]
The feds wanna take me down cause what I say on here is facts
I think I got a bad habit I keep walking out of Saks
I heard the opps said they want smoke with us but nevеr want to match
Niggas said they want to rob me but ain't nevеr doing that
I got locked up bonded out but I ain't never been a rat
Everything I say I live it I ain't never had to cap
20 thousand in my jeans looking like some thigh pads
Wake up work a 9-5 you might have to try that
You poor and need to get a job but you wouldn't mind that
I almost threw a temper tantrum they ain't have my size yet
This year alone I made 100 you ain't made you 5 yet
The money that I made today you still ain't seen it with your eyes yet
This bitch mad at me but I know she coming right back
I might go and cop a chain where your piece declined at
Davo doing drill to drill tryna push some minds back
This nigga said he smoking pressure I ain't even high yet
I'll go and drop a check drop a song then go drop a chain
I always knew I be a rich nigga didn't know about the fame
Remo got the SRT out on the road switching lane to lane
I'm walking around with 2 Glocks in my pocket like I'm max payne
I'll leave out with 10 bands and bring 100 back
You'll leave out with 10 phones and bring them bitches back
Opp bitch was sucking on my dick and then you kissed her ass
I'll drop a bag on your head them killers blitz your ass
My shooter got a AR with a scope he not gon miss your ass
You been window shopping all day long they finna kick your ass
I ain't gotta do no dirty work them killers blitz your ass
Nothing that you do or say is true you need to quit the cap
Aye watch your mouth
You disrespect we X you out
Your doing too much window shopping they gon fucking kick you out
I feel like Rick James I'm finna lay my feet on top her couch
She keep begging for my kids I'm finna put them in her mouth
Lately I been doing numbers niggas switching on me now
I got rich with no effort I see why they hate me now
Can't no nigga lil bro me I ain't never had a hand me out
I'll dm your bitch on the gram I bet she fanning out
I got rich in less than 6 months they wanna be me now
I'll let the Glock replace the muscle you can't beat me down
Why the hell your bitch keep texting me she wanna see me now
The sames one who said I wouldn't make it wanna be me now
