[Intro, Bandman Kevo]
Maybe if it was somebody 20x bigger than me that had more than me
Then yeah, I woulda been like, damn
But you talking about somebody who is broke
So it actually felt good to me cause I'm just like:
Yes, I'm rich
Yes, they broke
(
I'm smokin' straight out the pack
)
[Verse, Punchmade Dev]
I won't live another day if I don't wake up, hit a scam
I admit I'm fighting habits, its a part of who I am
Sometimes I wish I never found a way to scam
I can admit that I been stressin' like, I might really get jammed
This life I live is just a part of who I am
I can admit a got a bad addiction, scamming for a band
But I can't lie, that free money feel good when it's in hand
And I can't lie, I prolly never would be rich without that chance
It ain't еasy to get rich without a risk
Them illegal crimеs was worth it, I couldn't wait to bust my wrist
I know a peasant who can't wait to take my shit
They already tried it once, I almost yellow taped his shit
That pussy's lucky that I uped and dropped my clip
But I ain't trippin', I still got a couple off and popped his shit
He's lucky that the rest got stuck inside the clip
I tried to aim and hit his face, I almost Fetty Wapped his shit
Free Fetty Wap, I do the same thing in Lexington
I owe a thank you to my fein for testing it
I figured out the recipe and now I'm truly blessed and rich
I bring the blicky out of state, that mean I'm never checking in
If you catch me in a club that means I got my weapon in
Out in public, I'ma have it on me if I'm steppin' in
If you want me to put you on, I wax a 10
You speakin' to a punch god, with me you'll make a couple 10
My bitch pretty with an attitude, won't even look at you
Stop pocket watching me, I'm really rich, you need to look at you
You must be a dumbass tryna throw a hook or two
In love with Glockiana, if you book me, gotta book her too
