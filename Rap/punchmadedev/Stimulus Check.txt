[Intro: News Report]
Scammers now, taking advantage of the Stimulus Check's recipients posing as Government Representatives
Taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic
Some of you tell us your getting phone calls from someone
Saying, in order to get your Stimulus Check
You have to give them your name, address, and Social Security Number
[Hook]
Nigga put that band down
We know you flexin' with that Donald Trump check
What I spend inside the mall is out your budget, so you upset
You got more followers, than money
What I got, I could up that
You still broke, and on your ass
Asking nigga's can they front that
My hand out, askin' nigga's for some money?
That's a never
If you tryna run up on me, you can not be too clever
The way it's lookin' like for you, I can't see you rich ever
Got some money, and some killers
Make you disappear forever
[Verse 1]
You better play it smart, and think a lot 'bout what I say
You better use your fuckin' brain, before we blow it out your head
I got some nigga's who ain't Graduate
But, fill you up with lead
I see green in store, 'cause it's approved it's never red
I'm thankin' God for these bands, they so fire when I punch
I remember when my piece's, couldn't even buy me lunch
Spendin' racks in the mall, you can't afford what you touch
10,000 is a lot to you, to me that's not much
I was broke, copped a fire ass piece now I'm up
Swipin' cards, my hidden talent
I do not need no luck
The card I sold you wasn't burnt
You just dumb and you suck
I don't play no basketball
But, I'm like Giannis for my buck
When I throw I don't pick it up
But, you do 'cause you need it
You talkin' all this money talk
But, I don't ever think we seen it
I could quit and live off rap
But, I love scammin' I can't leave it
You was told 50 flip, and sent 500 you believed it
Yep, 'cause you a mo'fuckin' ham
Countin' 20's, 50's, 100's, only time I use my hands
Everybody 'round me eating, I don't gotta watch my mans'
You the type to send me money 3 times and still think it's not a scam
But, that's okay 'cause I need nigga's like you to make my pockets big
I don't stress 'bout what I'm spendin'
'Cause I know that I'm gon' make it back
Once I empty out all your accounts
You can have 'em back
I really live the life I rap, I don't fake my raps
