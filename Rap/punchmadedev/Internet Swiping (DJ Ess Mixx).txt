[Intro]
I’m well respected where I from, you better come correct
No, I'm not performing at your show for free, you got to cut a check-
No, I'm not performing at your show for free, you got to cut a check-
No, I'm not performing at your show for free, you got to cut a check-
[Chorus]
I’m well respected where I from, you better come correct
No, I'm not performing at your show for free, you got to cut a check
Well connected on the dark web, I need bins, they gon' give me that
I'll probably never find a band in your bank, that's where the penniеs at
Woke up and bought illegal guns on the 'nеt, now, I got plenty straps
I'm only eating steak and lobster, I just watched you buy a kiddie pack
I feel untouchable, I send my hacker, he gon' come get rid of that
I'm not gon' stop punching cards up till they stack to where my ceiling at
[Verse]
You work a job wake up and go get behind that register
I'm lying on my taxes, had to use a photo editor
I'm not trippin' on my ex no more, I'm way too far ahead of her
My new bitch from Calabasas, I already found a better her
You gon’ get rich then go cash out on a Hellcat, that's too basic
I'll pull up in some shit, you never seen before and win the races
I can't dance but I can moonwalk in these brand new human races
Hit his-hit his head and barely missed so now he got a taper
