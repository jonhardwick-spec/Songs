[Chorus]
I couldn't went to college but I'd rather wake up being a Jugg Star
My new house came with two stories, in the basement, yeah, the hood far
I feel like fuck life, I'm pouring lean, and I'm poppin' bars
I'm down bad, if I hit another one I won't see tomorrow
I'm driving thru the city busting scams, fuck the consequences
It's 9 AM, I know you late to work, go hop up in that Honda, bitch
Thirty clippin', fifty round drums, my Glock came with attached switch
If she don't hit the road, I go pick up all my phones, she ain't my type of bitch
She dont like to use her hands when she suck it, she on lazy shit
Gold shit inside my safe I can afford to bе on lazy shit
Walk in the party with my bust on I'm here to takе a pic
She was starstruck to see me in the club, she had to [?]
Explain to me how I ain't drop a song in months and I'm still up
Still wakin' up at check drops at 3 AM, that's how I'm still up
My bro a felon, but for me he'll grab a chop and he'll steal bucks
He's been tryna learn the scamss for 'bout a week, somehow he still suck
I'm on drugs, ain't got twenty in my pocket, so I'm walkin' with it
I got too many carats sittin' in my mouth, that's why I'm talkin' weird
We're pourin pennys here, we rockin with lean, won't touch no type of beer
Then bring a EDD and PP bag, that's my type of year
I couldn't went to college but I'd rather wake up being a Jugg Star
My new house came with two stories, in the basement, yeah, the hood far
I feel like fuck life, I'm pouring lean, and I'm poppin' bars
I'm down bad, if I hit another one I won't see tomorrow
I'm driving thru the city busting scams, fuck the consequences
It's 9 AM, I know you late to work, go hop up in that Honda, bitch
Thirty clippin', fifty round drums, my Glock came with attached switch
If she don't hit the road, I go pick up all my phones, she ain't my type of bitch
