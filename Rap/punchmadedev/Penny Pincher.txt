[Verse]
He was flexing in a Scat, but that's his girl's car
Shoot the whip up and record, put that shit on Worldstar
She fell in love with my dick, gave it four stars
I take a boujee bitch and turn her right into a pornstar
I never knew that I'd be richer than my peers
I lied, I been shitting on them every year
They gon' feel some type of way when I touch a million next year
Put me in the Hall of Fame of swiping, I'm the best tier
Bored as hell, spent three hundred on a pair of socks
Send me four bands right now, I'll send back a pint of wock
Dog shit on me, I can barely walk
Re-arrange his jaw with a Glock, he can barely talk
But, I think I like it way better that way
Blocked her number out my phone, she sent a love letter my way
*rip sound*
That's the sound of me ripping it up
I threw the money for the dancers, why are you picking it up?
It looks like we got a penny pincher
When I hit him with these knuckle dusters, he gon' need a pair of dentures
Percocet and a pint of Wock, I'm on a true adventure
Jugged a white man out his bread, he called me a niggeâ€Žr
Snuck my MSR inside the school, then I got expelled
Popped a student in my gym class, he was a tattle tale
He said sum' in that room that's how he got a bail
How is he a swiper? Last week, he was at Taco Bell
Don't play, like we ain't see you working at that job
If the feds run inside this crib, they'll think I'm with the mob
That's because I got this one method on how to make a bomb
I take innocent people's money, I know I'm wrong
Guess what? I really don't care
Steal paper and get away with it, life is not fair
They got the drop but only slide when I'm not there
I'm like a good student with the sauce, I cannot share
