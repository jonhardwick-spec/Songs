[Verse]
Where the drums at? I need one for my stick
Told my shooter stay inside the crib, cuz' he be on some shit
The last time we was OT in the Hilton, then he shot a bitch
We heard the news the next day, they said somebody mama hit
(Damn)
Now my shooter going on the run
I tried to tell him chill, but he like shooting at people for fun
Bet, I'm finna put you on a mission
Give me two hours, I can go and find the Glocks and switches
That mean in two hours, it's time for you to stand on business
I got the blueprint, listen close and pay attention
First you follow him home, we gotta find out where he living
Once he park in that garage, we gotta wait a couple minutes
(Hold on)
Look at this big ass crib, we don't know who in it
Look to the left, I think I see his mama cooking in the kitchen
Tuh, you know you can't leave out here with a breathing witness
Plus I threw a laser on the Glock there's no excuse for missing
I told him calm down, he took the strap and aimed it at the kitchen
It's too late, he cocked it back and popped her while she did the dishes
I'm like "Bro, what the fuck are you doing"
He look like he did this shit before, so I'm leaving it to him
(Come on)
He jumped out the whip, turned on the switch and started dumping
I can hear somebody screaming, but can't find nobody running
My shooter mad like "I know we ain't come this way for nothing"
I'm like "Why the fuck you kill the mom before you seen the son?"
I told you that that was the main target
You ain't wanna listen so now the mission gon' be way harder
We gotta find a way to play it way smarter
If we don't find him in two minutes, we gon' be real sorry
He started clapping at my shooter
We both got to ducking, I'm yelling like "Hurry and shoot him"
Bullets flying past my head, I almost got turned to a noodle
He dumped a couple more shots, went to reload and then my shooter
