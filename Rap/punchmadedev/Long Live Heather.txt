We learned today of major spikes in drug overdose deathsA record ninety-three thousand across the United States last year with Kentucky seeing a higher percentage increase
[Verse]
Oh, you need a pill? I used to press those
I came a long way, I won't forget my favorite custo' (Never)Now I got the fiends hooked, it's hard to say no
When they come back, they say they love the pills, I know, I laced those (I know)
I can't lie, the process wasn't perfect, I killed my tester
I gotta pay respects to my fiend Heather
She took my first pill and died, so it's shout out to Heather
I was really fucked up for a week, but I got it together (Come on)
Then I went back to the body with a suicide letter (Shh)
Sometimes I think that I should quit, but I know that's a neverIf you knew the PROs I made off music, you'd sell 'em foreverI quit pressin' pills in my room, then I threw out my dresserI just couldn't put up with the smell
I pray after I kill 'em with pills, I won't go to Hell
If 12 come kickin' in my door today, I'll sit in a cell'Cause they gon find seven different drugs, some weed, and a scale
But I'ma lie if I told you I cared (I'ma lie)
Tell me where the junkies stayin' at and I'm pullin' up there (I'm pullin' up)
If I don't, then that'd be rare
Give some laced pills out for free and then sit there and stareI'm tryna see somebody die todayBut it ain't my fault, they're the ones tryna get high today (Not my fault)
I'm tryna boost the stats to five a day (Let's go)
If he take this Xan, his family won't be havin' Father's DayBut that's okay, I never had one either (Never)
Was snaked by everybody in my family and it turned me evil
Now every time I press an ecstasy, I make sure that it's lethal
I promise if y'all make me president, then I'm makin' it legal (Come on)Like Make America Fentanyl Again
I'ma drop the recipe for Percs, let's hit all the tins (Let's go)
He thought he had a 'Wood full of 'za, but I gave his ass redThen he went crazy and lost his mind 'cause I laced his pen (Bitch)And now he livin' in a mental home
Now every time I hit a road trip, I bring crystals home (Crystal meth)I ain't talkin' 'bout the rocks, I'm bringin' crystal methI knew life was short when I seen my fiend OD to death
(Oh well, dumb-ass bitch)
