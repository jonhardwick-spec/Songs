[Intro]
Let's steal a kid like Sound of Freedom, let’s sell him for 50K, we just need a way to reach him
A bank transfer scam has left a huge hole in an Oceanside couples' life savingsIn February, Marc Beardsley was tricked into wiring $68,000 of his own money overseas, after a large sum of money appeared in his Wells Fargo checking account
[Chorus]
Send your bank account to me, you'll never see that shit again
Bring a Chase account to me, then I’ma drop a check for ten
I'm not a rapper (Nope), but to cover up, I might pretend (I might)
I'm the reason why there's more fraud, I made a trend (I'm the reason)
Why would I ever scam my fans?
We can split it down the middle, do you have an SSN?
Do you work at T-Mobile? If you do, lock me in'Cause I could punch a hundred phones in two days without walking in (Easy)
[Verse]
That's $100,000 in two days
Punch a phone or hit a *****, we can make that in two ways
I came a long way from playing on 2KI'm not sitting on the game, I’m outside busting a play
(
Peasant
)
You’re not rich, but I am, we don't relate (At all)
I’m a multimillion dollar criminal with super pape' (Millionaire)
Richest rapper from my city and my state
Every time I leave the house, I got bitches yelling my name
Every time I get around a bitch, she begging for my chain
You sell pics on OnlyFans for five dollars, that's a shame
It's a hundred-forty thousand dollar pendant without the chain
If I let you wear this bitch, it’ll never hit the same
I know you can't afford it, get the fuck up out my face
Never mind, you got good credit, let me take you on a date
(Come on)
I'm tryna open up three loans using your name
Quit that job and come and work for me, I'm giving better rates
You can't afford to sit with me, I paid five hundred for this steakI paid six hundred for this cup, I guess I got expensive tastePaid seven hundred for these jeans, they unreleased, you got to waitI paid eight hundred for these shoes, I wore them once, threw them away
