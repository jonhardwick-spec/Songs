[Verse]
I fuck wit' chase the long way
I make 10 thousand, Or more off of allstate
The only reason you ain't hit, Is cause you ain't hip
You doing the steps all the wrong way
Scared of who?, I'm doing fraud in broad day
Don't run down on me, That's the wrong play
The other day they tried to pull me over at the bank
I went on a chase on the highway,
7 Wires in a day that's a light day
500 Thousand that's light pay, Let me show you how to punch
Quit burning cards and come wit' me and do it the right way
I dare a rapper to come get in my way
You ain't doing shit to me your 5'8, I ain't never in the streets
I'm in the crib hitting jugg's working at a high pay
