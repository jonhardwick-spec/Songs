[Verse 1: Punchmade Dev]
Fell asleep with the money in my hand I had too much to count
Ill up a super mitt don't make me bring it out
I got a fresh roll of hunnid dollar bills came from breaching accounts
Ten thousand ain’t shit but to you that's a high amount
I know it sucks to be a peasant
And if you ever seen me out in public yes, I had weapon
Looked what's tucked in my Amiris that’s a FN
Come try and take a chain I got a grave for you to step in
Don't die tryna be a hood hero
Come bring me a bank account and ill add a couple zeros
Fuck the law I thinks it's time they free Guero
I hope they don't get me next, I'm finna punch another Turo
I can have some shooters at your crib soon as they hear the price
I can have some phones sent to your crib in just less then a night
I'm quick to pull the strap out of my pocket you blessed if we fight
I'm quick to pay my shooters out of pocket get stepped on tonight
[Verse 2: Trapboydre10k]
Fuck nigga play up in this bitch it's gonna be free me
All my opps hoes they gonna run when they see me
Put him on the news we gonna watch him on the tv
With them young niggas steady spinning like a CD
Got a Glock and a wood on me right now up in traffic
You gonna die first tryna think you the baddest
Never stop shooting when I up its automatic
I’m the type young nigga step in some fashion
Fuck school I was tryna trap in my classes
I know a real killer in the feds and he blast it
Opps tryna beef with me them niggas never lasting
Got a call he just died now I’m smoking laughing
Me and Dev gonna link up and go hit a new play
When I shoot I'm gonna score every time like its 2k
We don’t give a fuck run him down in broad day
I was selling grams up at school in the hallway
Always shoot first and I know I don't miss nigga
Dude he been mad cause I'm fucking on his bitch nigga
Imma still spin when I'm super rich nigga
Caught a opp lackin’ and I shot the whole clip nigga
