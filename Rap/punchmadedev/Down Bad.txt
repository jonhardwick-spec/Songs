(Verse 1)
Where was everybody at when i was struggling and down real bad
Now nigga's wanna be cool cause they see where a nigga at
Had to stay focused cut nigga's off then go chase me a bag
Nigga's broke so they mad, Other k you getting left in the past
(Verse 2)
Diamonds all up in my mouth i'm chasing that bag you chasing that clout, We gon' run up in your house with big Glocks and see what you about, Nigga's talking on that net but they never meet or wanna pop out, You ain't with it close your mouth for we slide down and let them shells out, Bitch you not trappin lil nigga you need to stop it quit with that acting, Keep it on me never lacking keep a Glock on my waist pistol packing, Shoot shit like the mavеricks make your homie disappear likе magic, We pull up get to clapping hop out and shit getting tragic, You ain't posted on that block you ain't holding on them Glocks, We know that's not how you rock, All you do is fucking talk, Why you dissing on the snap, Why you flexing with that strap
You pulled up and you ain't scrap, Choppa take you off the map
I remember them late nights sleeping on the streets with nowhere  to call home, I remember hitting nigga's up but back then they wouldn't answer the phone, Now they see where i'm at now they calling back they won't leave me alone, We slide down to your home and turn that shit to a drop zone
