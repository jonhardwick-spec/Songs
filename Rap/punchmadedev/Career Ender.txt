[Intro]
I'ma tell y'all how I do these niggas
I'm a internet demon nigga and I can get active
[Verse]
Let me tell you 'bout this one rapper who tried to beef
Yesterday he was on Instagram crying because I hit delete
Sent a warning letter to his email, I guess he didn't read
I said some like "If you don't pay me now then you ain't finna breathe"
I'm on his Soundcloud right now, tryna take it down
The last label that I worked with, I'm finna tear it down
It's a war and I ain't never gon' stop until I takе you out
You know I know who your wife is, I'm finna take her out
I got SSN's, еmails, and phone numbers so don't play
I'll give you 7 days to give my channel back or you gon' move away
He was tough talking on the phone but tryna get restrainings placed
I don't care about that shit, when I see you you meet the heaven gates
Don't ask what happened to your Instagram, I'm the one who took itDon't ask what happened to your YouTube vid, you know I took it down
I got your address if I don't see you I'm gon' spin around
I'ma pistol whip his ass and spit on him while he laying down
And I'ma do that to you already after I knocked you out
You gon' start another war if you fuck with what I'm dropping now
Fuck DefJam and that other label I done hold em' all
DefJam sent the bread through and then I blocked em' off
And that was like 2 years ago come get it back in blood
You and yo' bitch both together look like dirty mud
I never got paid for music streams but I got plenty dubs
When I delete you and your rappers y'all gon be sick tryna pennyhunt
Sent an email to me that you called the law but I don't care
On the net, I can ruin anybody and that got you scared
Let me know if they got a problem with me, I got bullets for 'em
I thought you was a tough guy, I got your car and then pulled it from you
I hope little junior go to bed and never see the world again
'Cause I can have some demons pull up like Afghanistan
Yes I grew up in the burbs but I can still clap a street nigga
I'ma have you and yo staff members in the street nigga
Y'all gon' be laying there asking for forgiveness but it's too late
When I put you in a wheelchair, you can't take your son to go and skate
I see yo label name but I ain't never seen y'all run it up
I'm undefeated in this beef shit y'all know y'all fucking up
