[Intro]
(
Runnit
)
"And then fuck me good," like, you talkin' weird as fuckDropped oneBeen all the hoes, I been all through different tutorials, rightYou fuckin' all the hoes, nigga
[Chorus]
Wake up, hit checks for thirty days, and then go missin' (I'm gone)
My mansion got a gate around that bitch, you're in the trenches
They can say whatever they want in Lexington, but who's the richest?
We could take it there, I'll pay a hundred thousand dollar ticket (Let's do it)
Just because I'm out of town, don't start thinkin' that you're safe
Just because I'm in the 'Raq, don't start thinkin' I can't play
From Chicago to Kеntucky, I'ma always have my Drac' (Draco)
I might not do it myself, but I can send somеone that way (Let's go)
[Verse]
I'm rich, of course they dropped that petty gun case (Dumbass)Y'all can have that Glock, I like totin' FNs anyway
You're broke (Peasant), poor as fuck, and on the block all day (Haha)
I'm in the suburbs, watchin' how y'all get tapped in the face
Quit lyin' in your music, you ain't never shot at me (Quit the cap)
Y'all be cappin' for attention, you ain't never took from me
I got chains, watches and I got some pendants, every piece (Every piece)
Y'all be postin' moissanite replica chains, show receipts
I'm from the 'burbs, but until somebody touch me, I'm a thug
I celebrate on August 21st, I **** somebody up
It was 3 a.m. at the ATM, I popped somebody up
On God, I upped it—, while he was runnin' up
