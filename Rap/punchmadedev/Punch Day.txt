[Chorus]
Apple dropped a phone today, it's a punch day
I guess I'm finna hit a holy jugg, on a Sunday
If I keep punching phones, I could have twenty by Monday
I got AirPods, Macs, and iPhones, I had fun today
On the dark web, I just bought another gun today, *typing noises*
I'm not finna see the sun today
Venmo burnt out, I tried to hit that play the other day
They shut my favorite scam down, but I got plenty other ways
[Verse]
I'm like Mr. Krabs, I'm stingy with the sauce
I shoulda been a teacher at my school, they listen when I talk
I shoulda brought an extra bag with me, I'm limping when I walk
I shoulda brought an extra cup with me, I'm feening for the Wock
My fiends love to call me Chris Rock, no not because I'm funny, everyday I give em' rocks
Everyday that go by, I sit there and I watch em' rot
The neighbors next door keep snitching on me like "He's smoking pot"
And that's because we ain't in the hood we in the burbs'
They don't like the smell of dead opps, I'm getting on they nerves
At least I'm not living by poor people, that's way worse
At least I'm not one of them store people, they hate work
Damn, that bucket broke down, you late to work
He missed another paycheck, he won't have a dollar by the first
Plus his rent due, he gon' get evicted by the first
As soon as he break up with his bitch, he gon' be on the curb
