[Part 1]
[Intro]
Come on
(
I feel so Euphoria
)
[Verse]
You're a peasant, quit begging for sauceI already know you can't afford it, don't ask what it cost
This lifestyle ain't for you, I was born to do fraud
You're just a
nigga
in the hood, totin’ guns on the block
You got a social? Bring it here and we could run it
I'm the one yo’ favorite rapper runnin' to when he need money
Look, I got proof, it's getting super ugly
You went broke tryna’ be a rapper, we are not buddy-buddy (Nah)
I took a break from Instagram, that broke shit rubbin' off quick
Quit flexing with that petty twenty thousand, that shit piss me off
You doin' too much on Instagram so I'ma take you off
You ain't put me on or show me methods, I'm who make the sauce
If I gеt caught bussin' a play then I'ma take the fall
I know y'all finna snitch, that’s why I nеver cared to break y'all off
That's a bet, now I'm takin’ off
[Part 2]
[Verse]
I fuck wit' chase the long way I make ten-thousand or more off of all state
The only reason you ain't hit, is because you ain't hip, you doin' all of the steps the wrong way
Scared of who, I'm doin' fraud in broad day
Don't run down on me, that's the wrong play
The other day they tried to pull me over at the bank, I went on a chase on the highway
Seven wires in a day, that's a light day
Five hundred thousand, that's light pape'
Let me show you how to punch, quit burning cards and come with me and do it the right way
I dare a rapper to come get in my way
You ain't doing shit to me, you're 5'8"
I ain't never in the streets, I'm in the crib hittin' juggs workin' at a high pay
