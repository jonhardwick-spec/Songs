[Hook]
On god this money got me acting different
One hundred thousand worth of gift cards, I'm really active with it
Real grimy I'll still charge for a pint with no ac'y in it
I know your parents bought them clothes return them now, you look tacky in them
I got all the sauce,
I'm the one who plugged the plug
I'm sitting back with all the drops, I can slide and
send out slugs
My demons slid through all them blocks, left your family in the mud
I like stepping on my opps, so I put faces on the rug
[Verse]
We not sparing not a soul so don't get caught inside the crossfire
Fifty rounds and up all my Glocks be customized and high powered
I'm rеally up I got two hoes with me inside my showеr
It's really up when I see you out just duck this nine shower
I paid one hundred for this eighty you better not ask me to pass
I wanna see your kids die don't ever think you get a pass
I'd love to see your momma cry can't wait to clap her ugly ass
Put on my Dior 1's you won't catch me stepping in no grass
Sike I got me one let me go and stomp him in the grass
Can't wait to drop some, you will never see my toe with tags
Before I pop someone, I'ma aim and blind them with the flash
You had them shoes on for a year it's kinda funny you ain't buy them
You got my old designer on it's kinda funny you ain't buy it
You should be the king of cap rap and go get paid for all this lying
I feel like the king of CashApp they send the bread I leave them crying
I paid a thousand for this flight the plane gon' land me on a island
It's so sad your peoples died, he couldn't make it out his hometown
It's like music to my eyes, wish I could see them all just die now
I got them on your ass now you better not stop at no stop sign
You was talking choppy on the gram in person you a shy guy
You broke without no money now but in high school you was a fly guy
I know where you stay but I would rather catch you on my side time
I put deadly chemicals inside that drank you like the taste of it?
I hope you like them Xans that I gave you cause I double cut it
No, I don't have no regards for human life I'm tryna get some money
I'm have three baby mommas
all my sons gon grow up crash dummys
But I'ma teach them how to move so they don't end up like your last homie
But I'ma teach them how to shoot so I don't gotta drop a bag on you
