[Intro: Adam22, Teejayx6]
He didn't wanna fight?
Nah I didn't wanna fight it was three niggas and a gun
Punchmade Dev would of just smoked your ass right there
I feel like he would of just shot me, he would of shot me bro, I know he would of
[Chorus]
When I go out of town I ain't linking with rappers
Where all the scammers and trappers?
Where all the scammers on instagram who don't be cappin'?
I'm tryna make somethin' happen
This Glock got a switch on it, I'm ready for action
They said I can't come to the city, I should be there right now and nothing never happened (What happened)
I took your money and I'm still alive
You should go follow me on instagram I'm prolly flexing with it while on live
Look, there go yo money right there go check it out you could see it online
Go to my youtube channel right now I'm spending your money like it's mine
[Verse]
I know you're mad you'll never get it back (Your pissed)
Why'd you leave a comment on my page asking me to send yo money back?
Are you a dumbass?
Look at the video I already spent that (Its gone)
Look at the chain I'm wearing right now, that's where the money is at (Haha, look at my chain)
Y'all hear that sound?
What would I do if it wasn't for you?
What would I do if you wasn't around?
What would I do if you wasn't a clown?
What would I do if it wasn't for banks?
What would I do if I quit right now?
