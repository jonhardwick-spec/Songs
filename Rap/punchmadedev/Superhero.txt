[Chorus]
Don't die tryna be a superhero
Check the stats, I just left your PNC with triple zeros
It's gone forever you can't click reverse
He took his last thousand to his name, and bought his bitch a purse
Do your dead man a favor, and put him on a shirt
He got hit with a top fader, left his brains all in the dirt
I slid and they locked the door behind me, they know what's happening
Last year, I was penny pinching, until I pulled a magic trick
