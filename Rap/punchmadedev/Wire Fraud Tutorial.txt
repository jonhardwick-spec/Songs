Most of you might not be aware, but there is a group by the name of PunchmadeGoing around doing bank fraud, credit card fraud, check fraud, and all sorts of things
[Verse]
Everybody listen up, this aâ€” damn, I said that last time
Listen up, I'm finna show y'all how to hit a bank
Just pay attention, this a quick way to jugg in any state
First you wanna get a bank log from a trusted site
Do your research because the information must be right
You gotta be on point, don't be sittin' around tryna get high
Hit a big play, don't get booked for a petty-ass crime
Do they got Verizon or they work for Sprint?You gotta know that if you wanna hit this lick
You gotta call up to the company and SIM swap that bitch
So you can get the phone calls and text message that they get (Easy)
You need that so you can log in with the code
But before you do that, make sure that you don't do this wrong
Don't let let me find out that your dumb ass tried to log in through the phone (Dumbass)
You gotta change your location into their home
For that, you're gonna need an RDP serverIt should come with their IP, you gotta plug it in the server
This might be a lil' hard, but it's hard bein' a workerThe bank'll give they money back, so ain't nobody hurtin'
(Access granted)You just got in the accountDon't be gettin' too excited when you see the first amount'Cause there's a certain way you gotta wire all the money outDon't be fuckin' up the play or you gon' sit there down and out
Now you need a runner you can wire all the money to
Make sure you break 'em off a good amount, they gon' want money too (Break 'em off)
You might need 'em for another play, let 'em run in for you
Some banks be askin' hella questions, so it's hard to do
Okay, you SIM swapped, got a runner, and a bank
Now it's time for you to wipe down all the money that they made
Go and send the wire out, send it straight to the runner's bank
If you did everything right, then it's gon' be a piece of cake (Easy)
Now that the wire went through, listen up
The money's basically yours if you don't somehow fuck it up
I can't forget my first play, I was somewhere turnin' up
Make sure you hit it while you can because the hams gon' burn it up
Have the runner go inside, tell him withdraw all the pape'
If it's a big play, have somebody wait outside the bank'Cause they might try to run off and we don't play about our pape'Imagine doin' all that work and someone run off with your play
