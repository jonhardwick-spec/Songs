[Verse]
Should I rap or should I stick to my addiction?
Should I trap or should I keep punchin' in credit card digits?
I'm trying to find another fiend, I'm in the kitchen
I got too many options, all of them come with a sentence
I heard they said the police on my trail, but I'm still livin' free (Where they at?)
Long live Heather, I'm a pill legend, I let her live through me
I think it's time for me to start givin' out pills for free
Here go a fake pill for you, I'm keepin' the real ones for me
I'll backdoor my own mans, don't be playing with me
In my traphouse, I got a couple fiends stayin' with me
It make it easier for me to make them get paper to me
I can show you how to make a mil' off pills, I'll tell you for free (Come on)
First, you want to get a real bag of Percocets
Pour them on a table, spread it out, see what you workin' with
This probably ain't for you if you ain't never seen or heard of it
You gon' have a couple hiccups, long live Heather, she's a murder kit
Okay, once you get the pills, you need Fentanyl
It's okay if you're running low on pills, we finna stretch them all
This the play, gather up all of the pills, we finna crush them all
If you're greedy, you can triple cut the pills like me, I need it all
Let me guess, you forgot to buy the pill presser?Grab a piece to go punch it off Amazon 'cause the shipping is better
Grab a good one unless you don't care to make a new Heather
I'm tryna tear a happy family down, I can kill them together
Wear gloves, you gotta make sure you keeping it clean
Grab the Percocets and Fentanyl, put it in the machine, press the pill down and
stamp the M, get it right for the fiends
When you finish that, go to the hood, but don't start a big scene
Make sure they're dressed up like a bum, so you fit in the hood
Once you get clientele, start paying fiends to make sure that it's good
Tell them be a lookout because the police be all in the hood
Give a couple of samples out for free
They come back when it's good, but they can't come back when they dead
I got a strange addiction, I get really excited when they dead
I don't know where I would be at if I wasn't selling medsNever mind, I'd probably be somewhere scamming, laying in bed
