I ain't lyin' like TeeJay
I'ma teach you how to scam
If you really swipin' cards, why he scammin' all his fans?

Then he turned around and ran
Took his flow so I could get on
I ain't never been a fan
Nigga sayin' that it's smoke
What's gon' happen whеn you see me?
(
What are you gonna do to me whеn you see me?)(Nothin'
)
Nigga rappin' in his songs 'bout some shit he seen on TV
Nigga said he gotta him and I don't ever think we seen 'em
