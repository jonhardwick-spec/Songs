[Intro]
This my second-
[Verse 1: Punchmade Dev]
This my second pint today I'm moving like a zombie
I'm lookin like a white man in the store I'm dressed in Abercrombie
I'm on some call of duty shit I built the parts to make a tommy
If my gun jam I know I'm still straight Khi got the drake behind me
He thought he was safe they spunt his crib put yellow tape around it
You would've thought we killed a hundred people how the draco soundin
I think its time for me to kill my plug cause my head keep poundin
I think it's time for me to take this watch off my wrist keep drowning
[Verse 2: IghtKhi]
I got thirty-thousand in my mouth Imma keep on smiling
Sold him a thirty pack of percs but it was really tylenol
Talking rеally tough on that facebook post but you ain't really sliding
I'm off the drank I'm dozing off likе I'm Joe Biden
I ain't really into throwing hands I like to pole fight em
They already dropped yo mans but y'all both dying
Drop the bag up on yo head and have yo mom and daddy both cryin
Was slapping at a vacant house I was boat buying
[Verse 3: Punchmade Dev]
I can't introduce my niggas to a rapper cause they chain snatchin'
I could make ten thousand dollars every day give me a pape' patek
My bitch exclusive she came from russia her in the k matching
I just threw 100 bullets at em I don't play madden
I don't gotta post my mitt no more they know I'm pape' havin
I'm in a stolen whip if I see 12 I'm speedin right past em'
My shooter left his body unreadable they had to trash bag em'
We just caught a 100 piece from Cali the plug trash bagged em'
