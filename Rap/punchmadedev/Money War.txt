[Intro]
They're sluts who just want to fuck anything
They see your a rapper
They see your little chains
They want to fuck you
And that's what it is
So they are gonna try to come to you
Out of all of them you stand out the most
(I'm Smoking straight out the pack)
[Chorus]
8 thousand for my fit I'm expensive
We don't share the same struggle, I ain't grow up in the trenches
(Never)
We don't got the same chain mine's got a couple inches
All my diamonds in my chain, yours got a couple missing
(Come on)
Let's have a money war and show the world who is the richest
(Let's go)
Start a live strеam and show us all that money from the pictures
(Whеre's it at?)
Your the one who's only rich inside a picture
My MIT don't compare to yours because I made it way quicker
(Pheasant)
[Verse]
Private life, private jet, that's how I'm living
I just sat here for an hour to count a hundred thousand in it
(100k)
Yes I booked an extra seat that's for my pendant, that's just a quick reminder that I'm winning
(I'm up)
You can't compete, you gonna need a couple loans for what I'm spending
You gonna see somebody home when I start grinning
Look at me both my wrists is fully blown I got them twinnin'
Pay that fee and I'll cook a check for you and even print it
(Come on)
Sit back kick my feet up while I bust a play
They can't understand how I'm not signed and got a bunch of pape
They can't understand how I'm outside and still can show my face
But I know exactly why cause if they try I shoot them in the face
(Come here)
Don't get put inside an ash tray
I'ma touch a million a 100 times before I see my last day
(On god)
I'ma hit a 100 scams on my last day
Come join my tele chat and make a 50 ball the fast way
(Come on)
