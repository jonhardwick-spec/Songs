[Chorus]
Metal with me like the Wizard Of Oz
One hundred gippies, I'm the Wizard Of Fraud
I'm so flawless, I'll never get caught
I'm the GOAT of punching, they wanna come and get taught
You better hide that credit card I take those
I'll have my right hand mans come slide and kill you like Ksoo
He got a strange addiction for the draco
He like to kill people like he Tadoe
[Verse 1]
You turnt him up he got turnt into ashes
Like the fox on GameCube whеn it's beef we crash it
I just made twenty thousand can you match it
I thrеw a bullet how the fuck he get tackled
Happy punch day, I just woke up with cake
In the first ten minutes I ran up a K
I was down bad, then I punched me a way
He's a rookie swiper
, can't make ten in a day
Go ask the banks why they hate me
If rapping don't work, I'ma still be jugging when I'm eighty
Labels can't make me sign for any payment
Because what the rappers touch I'm making daily
First piece ain't hit so i'm spinnin' again
Nevermind, last time it got caught in the wind
Tip-toe in the back then I'm gone with the wins
I was fresh off a loss gotta play for the win
