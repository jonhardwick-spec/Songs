[Intro]
Thank you [?], that is so sweet
Bitch, come on
[Chorus]
Whoever said
juggin
' dead, I hope they speaking for theyself
Addicted to my CashApp and sending payments to myself
(come on)
Hop on a solo mission, watch me take the risk myself ([?])
If I get flicked I ain't tripping, I know I can pay that bail
I pulled a thousand different scams I know I never left a trail (never)
'Cause if I did I promise you they probably would've gave me life in jail
I pay the bills for my street, the neighbors not gon' tell (they not)
Lately I been catching all my Jacks through my neighbors mail (give me that)
[Verse]
Apple Pay
banned me for life, you gotta pay through
Zelle
I threw a scammer party with the hoes and I retired my scale (yeah)
You couldn't get inside till you brought me a Wells
One bitch gave me a fake Fargo account, she better tuck her tail (bitch)
Load the whip with
fifty clones
, I'm going on a frenzy
I can hit the same store fifty times, shoutout to Mckenzie (I love her)
When I move out of state just know she coming with me
I probably have to leave my city soon 'cause I can peep the envy
I got some real killers around me, tell them "Come and get me,"
I've been tryna stay humble for years, but now it's getting tricky
Watch me pull a hunnid out my safe, there ain't no faking image
I bought a first class flight with the puncher, I had to take it with me
I'm fucking up the Scat Pack, the donuts got me dizzy
Just dropped of 20 guns to my bro I told him "Go get busy," (go get busy man)
I need to quit juggin' but it's way too tempting
I can tell you never hit a play you just painted an image
