[Intro: Adam22, Teejayx6]
He didn't wanna fight?
No I didn't wanna fight it was three niggas and a gunPunchmade Dev would of just smoked your ass right thereI feel like he would of just shot me, he would of shot me bro, I know he would of
[Chorus]
I'm rich, you're poor
You'll never look like thisYou can't even pay for like half of my shit
Take a look at my jewelry, I'm havin' this shit (Look at it)
I'm outside, havin' a blast
They said if I come outside, then I'm hit (Where they at?)
You see me in public and walk right past (Hm)
You're just mad you ain't rich
You was supposed to take something from me (What happened?)It sounds like you never did
I nevеr upped a gun inside the mallYou sound likе a snitchYou sound like a bitch (A bitch)
I would've killed somebody right in front of my kids
You got some clout, left before I pulled up on youRight there, that was the end (Ha, ha, ha)
[Verse]
What do you mean you work a nine-to-five?
What do you mean you be rollin' up Woods in your story but don't got a car you could drive
(Haha) nope
You is a broke ass bum, you could never come kick it wit' meShow me 10K right nowI don't believe you have it, don't step closer to meBack up, I feel like that broke shit be rubbin' off (Get away)You don't have motion, we can't talk
Every rapper be runnin' to me when they flop (Ha, ha, ha, ha)Since when did I look like the fall-off hero?You look like you finna cry, I would too if my bank said nothin' but zeroes
