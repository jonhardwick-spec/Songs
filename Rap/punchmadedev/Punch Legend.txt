[Verse]
Flex a hundred K on Instagram, they gon' for sure hate (Come on)
And that's not even half of what I can showcase
On God, I be touchin' ten thousand on a slow day
On God, I be makin' thirty thousand, add up both days (On God)
I'm not you, I got receipts to back up everything I say
I'm not you, I go to sleep with half a million in my bank
We can't relate unless you broke three money counters in a day
I got expensive habits, I just paid two hundred for a plate
Over here, we livin' differently
I'll spend that fifty ball you flexin' with, you are not rich to me
I'm a punch legend, I'll go down in history
I don't pay taxes, that's the only reason Forbes ain't listin' me
It's sad y'all be out here wearin' fits less than my cologne
I could really buy a house off my closet just alone (Come on)
I'm rich, if you're a peasant, get the fuck out of my phone
Cut both my bitches off, that's the type of time I'm on
I hope you didn't think I needed you
Just because you helped me hit a play don't mean I'm keepin' you (Bitch)
If I was you, I would be heated too
I found out you's a ho, so that's the same way I'll be treatin' you
I can make a band quicker than I can count it with my hands
Made a quick six hundred dollars off a combo with a ham
Used to only shop online until I found out how to jam
I used to hit for petty plays until I found the ID scans
And now it's all green
Didn't nobody put me on the wave, nah, this was all me
Ask around, I pop somebody up when they try to rob me
If was you, I wouldn't have hesitated, I would've shot me
