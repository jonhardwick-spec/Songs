[intro]
But, yeah that's it, we hope you have a good flight
Bye, have a nice flight
We love you so much Dev (kissing noises)
Its time to repay your favor to the dime
[Chorus]
I’m hitting banks, dropping checks, cooking clones and cracking cards
I hope nobody told you that scamming was hard
I hit BOA seven times this week, tryna switch up my car
I been punching everything I see I been going too hard
My bitch came from Italy, had to match with my car
I seen yo' bitch twerking on OnlyFans, tryna be a new star
I can get them Apples in for free if you down to drive far
I hope nobody told you that scamming was hard
[verse 1]
We can't shake hands, you ain’t never seen a million
Why would I quit writing dumps, I already made a killing
I do bank wires fraud and clones, I'm into stealing
I need the track 1, with thе track 2, that's how I'm feeling
Simple minded bitch, I bet shе fucked me cuz I'm flashing hunnids
I might use the switch, you got lucky if I don't get to dumping
Regions, Chase and BOA, drop him in and I'ma run him
Bring me, a couple different banks, and you can be my runner
