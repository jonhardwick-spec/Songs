[Prod Tag]
Ayo KJ kill these niggas
[Chorus]
I heard them niggas say they finna put a blitz on me
Take that watch off and give it back to yo big homie
They said that I'm famous so I gotta keep a stick on me
We just smiled at yo bitch and now she wanna come and kiss on me
I can spend 10 bands in the mall cause I'm that nigga now
I can spend 2 bands on a shirt cause I got chicken now
I can talk that money talk in all my songs because I get it now
I can go and spend this money in the mall my life's expensive now
[Verse]
They gon' let me buy exclusive shit because I'm VIP
Don't put my name in any of yo' songs or that's a RIP
You be working with yo' momma you ain't swiping you bе selling tees
Green beam on the Glock whеn I shoot its always good release
Just seen my ex bitch drive by I think she stalking me
Plenty demons all around me and I think they tryna' talk to me
My YouTube doing numbers now so they want go and start a beef
Go put yo' homie way up in the sky and they gon' start a streak
I'm with Rago we gon' blow don't need the industry
We everywhere that money bag at don't be out in the streets
Banks approving every check that I go drop I got it to a T
With my buffs on right with the covid mask so they won't know it's me
The police wanna lock me up so they can put that hold on me
Even when you looking thru yo' fake buffs won't see the hoe in me
Went and put a quarter million up that's for the older me
Just took a trip in first class and you don't even gotta see
