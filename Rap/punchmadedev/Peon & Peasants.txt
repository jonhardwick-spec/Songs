[Intro]
MCX on the track

[Chorus]
It's time to move when I'm around
Peon
and Peasants I get irritated
You couldn't get the sauce from me so now you purely hating
700,000 in three months, that's my situation
You leaving hate comments on my page but you'd switch me places
Don't lie, you wish you had a mil like mine
From the outside looking in, you wanna switch your life with mine
I'm important; when I shop I skip the line
Need special treatment from my mid the pockets came in triple size
[Verse]
My first million, Im'a split it with my sides
If you ever stole from me, I can't call you one of mine
Exotics only, it's expensive when I drive
My whole life I had a car, I never had to hitch a ride
Take off that cheap ass chain, you can't compete
That little ass pendant make it truly hard for us to read
Them cloudy ass diamonds make it truly hard for us to see
Unlike you I got real diamonds, Im'a pop you if you reach
I'm court-side, it's 5,000 for my seat
The white people horrified,
I got rich of pills
and weed
Every day I wake up, it's a brand new shopping spree
I lied about selling these percs, I probably end up popping these
