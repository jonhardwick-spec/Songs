[Intro]
Cmon, It was me
[Verse 1]
It was me, It was me who had that Chase account and posted my receipt I can show proof at any time I made 250 in 3 weeks
I can show proof at any time that I can get you gone for cheese
I got 30 thousand in my teeth
Look at me you see that car you drive around when I say cheese
Look at you we see that chain you got for cheap its all CZs
God could kill me if I'm lying all my diamonds double Vs
I'm not impressed by that petty chain, I got 3 in my pocket
Plus the 3 around my neck I see a Cuban then I cop it
30 Credit cards on me look like I picked somebody pocket
I got a bad addiction wake up cook a check and then I drop it
On God somebody tried to rob me once before but then I popped him
We just got back from a tour but wasn't on it cause we poppin'
I'm on the road stealin' shit but I ain't robbin'
I hit bigger plays in Texas made 100 outta' Austin
I'm tired of hearing y'all rap about plays y'all ain't never hit
A million dollars in less than half a year that's something I really did
The quarter million off of fake pills I used to ship em' in
Rap money ain't never been enough I gotta get it in
You ain't never seen an M
Let alone a hundred thousand
My family isn't poor I never lived in public housing
I'll be damned if my family couldn't even stack a thousand
I'd be embarrassed too if I couldn't pay rent under a thousand
I'm in the suburbs I ain't never in the hood
I've been up my whole life, you can't relate you wish you could
You don't feel relevant unless you say you from the hood
White people taught me how to shoot I'll blast you in the hood
You're a grown man with no pape', no cars still stuck in the hood (C'mon)
Since when did that become cool
At least make some money out of it if you gon' break the rules
At least have more money than yo gun if you gon' pack a tool
