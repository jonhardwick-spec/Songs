[Intro]
A local family is out twenty thousand dollarsThey say they were scammed out of it and they think others may have been victims as well
[Chorus]
It's just me, my puncher, and that's it
If I can't get to you today, then I get mad and throw a fit
I can't separate from you, you the one that got me rich
I'm never breaking up with you 'cause ain't nothin as good as this
My life is good, I wake up to my desk, and I plug you in
It's like I'm living in a dream, got 201s with the pin
If I ever had to rate you, it's a ten out of ten
I've been ducked off for a week 'cause I'm locked in with you again
[Verse]
It's impossible to split us, it's me and you to the еnd
We can sit here and punch it out, just mе and you and no friends
You're the missing piece to all the troubles I been in
You're the reason that I'm stressed when you ain't here, I pop a 10
When I'm with you, I feel complete
When I'm with you, I feel like him
I'm not switching up, I'm staying with you 'til the end
Let's be partners in crime until the police take us in
[Pre-Chorus]
This feel like a love story straight from a movie that don't end
This feel like a punch story straight from a movie that don't end
