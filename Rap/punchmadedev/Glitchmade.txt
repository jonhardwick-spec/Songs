[Intro]
Social media has been a gold line for Scammers. We're talking mega millions. The Federal Trade Commission says one fourth of all fraud victims last year-
[Chorus]
I got a glitch for everything I got the whole world to a learn how
I got half rich off fraud, the other half came from a drug house
My sneaky link brought me seven bands, I'm in love now
I'ma teach you how to hit a Chase, here go run down
Every day I run up 5k before the sun down
Her instagram likes say and others, this bitch is mud now
[Verse]
In high school you was a bad bitch, now you're fat and poor
In high school you was a hoop star, now you wax the floor
I’ma scam to a M, could give a fuck about a rap award
It's two hundred just to give mе neck, I be taxing whores
Evеry local rapper in my city next up of course (Ha)
Let's go rack for rack pussy, that’s how I check the score (Come on)
I got enough pape to get you ****** if you asking for it
You get slapped and sent to the store, why are you capping to her?
True gentlemen, I kicked her out, but I packed it for her
She was hella shy until we met, look what happened to her
Now I got her running house to house, I got a package for her
She don't even do no leg work, I track it for her
Just stacked my hundredth iPhone, give me a jack award
He was tough toned but ended up dying, give him a lack award
