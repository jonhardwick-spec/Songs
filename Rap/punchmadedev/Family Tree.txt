[Verse]
Scammer of the year, they need to put me on a magazine (Put mе on it)
Twenty hollow tips plus ten more, that's in my magazinе (That's thirty)
I dumped a clip plus one more and make a murder scene (Come here)
Bust the block down and play my music so they know it's me
Let's take a look inside your closet, every shirt in here is cheap (Let's look)
We not finna act like we ain't seen you wear that shirt three times this week (Come on, now)
I gotta stay away from BIN numbers, I might tweak (Ah)
Super strange addiction, punch a hundred cards every week (A hundred cards)
And we on they ass every week
The criminals vouching for me, I'm verified on every street
Monkey finger Backwood, I'm so high, I could barely think
Like George Floyd, I could barely breathe (Oh, shit)
If you got a bank account, bring it straight to me (Bring it in)
When it's time to make some quick pape', they know to come to me (Let's go)
Bought a fifty-round drum for all my shooters, we the drummer team (Drummer team)
Why would I go back and forth with opps when they all under me? (Why?)
High as hell staring at my Wock' like, "Why's it bubbly?" (Bubbly as fuck)
Bad as fuck on Instagram, but in person, she so ugly (How?)
Yes, this is VVS diamonds, now stop touching me (Yes)
We just met today, how the fuck are you in love with me? (It don't make sense)
I know why, 'cause I'm Punchmade (Punchmade)
In middle school, you had free lunch, I had my lunch made (Lil' bitch)
Still stuck in the hood, it's like your family never got paid (Come on)
I never had to live inside the hood, my mama been paid (Never)
Hustling run in my family
Think about it, everybody's poor on your family tree (How?)
I want credit cards, dumps, and fake checks under my Christmas tree (On God)
Mean mug again and I'ma blow the strap that's next to me
