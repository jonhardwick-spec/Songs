[Hook]
I'ma get the money, let you nigga's have the hoes
We know that money, that you flexin' in your picture a week old
Might have to go and buy a Hellcat, off them phones that I sold
I went in, and got right out 'cause I got bail, I never told
I think these nigga's startin' beef for no reason
'Cause I'm bigger
Or it might because my nigga's clapped his mans' and he ain't get up
On God, when I wake up I make a band soon as I get up
I got like 3 stacks in my closet, I get new one's when it fill up
[Verse 1]
You ain't really no rich nigga
When shе find out, she gon' leave
What I'm makin' off thеse jugg's, it's just so much you couldn't believe
Sittin' courtside with the Wildcats, I'm coolin' with the team
I'm Mr. Perfect, I'ma superstar
I really live my dream
I ain't focused on no beef
You will never truly win
'Cause these nigga's do whatever
For some petty ass revenge
I can kick it with myself, I ain't never need no friends
'Cause I know if I go broke, they ain't gon' have me 'til the end
Now that I got some for myself, the one's around me actin' weird
I ain't believe 'til I seen it, made 300 in a year
And I ain't never sold my soul
But I could buy you, make you disappear
I ain't have shit on me, now I do
Yeah I persevere
