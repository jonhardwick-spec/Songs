[Chorus]
You can look me in my eyes, you see the pain in them
Me and myself been at war, before the fame nigga
I had to cut a couple niggas off I seen the fake in em'
You went and changed up on yo guys, I’m still the same nigga
Them prosecutors they on my head, don’t know how to feel
I was too deep in that water, had no time to heal
I know some niggas want me dead, cause I want a mil'
Payed some 40 years in that slamo, cause he said I steal
[Verse 1]
You looked me in my face and lied, so now it’s fuck you nigga
And you telling people you gon' kill me, so wassup lil' nigga
I see why you mad, I know why you hatin', it’s cause our bands way bigger
You say you was about it, but when you see me in the streets you ain’t pull the trigger
All my niggas came from nothing, straight from poverty
I got booked up in that county for a robbery
Police takin all my brothers, we jus tryna eat
I’m gon' rock out by myself until my niggas free
I’m tryna make it, but I’m doing wrong the feds don’t know about it
I got locked up, I got caught with a gun, you niggas joked about it I’m down for the gang, I swear I won’t change, swear I’m gon' ride about it
Better stay in your lane, before you get banged cause we gon' slide about it
[Chorus]
You can look me in my eyes, you see the pain in them
Me and myself been at war, before the fame nigga
I had to cut a couple niggas off I seen the fake in em'
You went and changed up on yo guys, I’m still the same nigga
Them prosecutors they on my head, don’t know how to feel
I was too deep in that water, had no time to heal
I know some niggas want me dead, cause I want a mil'
Payed some 40 years in that slamo, cause he said I steal
