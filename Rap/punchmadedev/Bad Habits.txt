[Intro]
(
Fuck the feds, free 2-4 'til it's backwards bitch!
)
(Free 2-4, nigga)
I'm in the mall, with 10k in my Louie bag
You better run from this beam
This ain't laser tag
I know you mad, your brother gone
And you can't get 'em back
Ever since I've known you
You've been broke and you been down bad
I'll drop 5 bands and your head, and they'll go get it
Gettin' money too addicting, I don't ever think I'll quit it
I ain't signing with no label, I need a million-dollar ticket
You ain't at least make a band a day, then I don't wanna kick it
[Hook]
I be in here, talkin' shit you really rap
Free my brother, I might lose him
'Cause these nigga's in there rats
Last nigga dissin' on K-Bands
Done got his ass clapped
I think I got a bad habit
I keep walkin' outta Saks
I ain't worry 'bout your nigga, you can't bring thе dead back
Don't be reachin' for my chain, that's gon' gеt your head cracked
Finessed a nigga outta thousand
You can't get your bread back
He could be right here livin' with you
But, he shouldn't have said that
