[Verse 1: Turban Rocket]
Bitch tryna fuck she walked in and seen the money counter
Niggas in my phone talkin' money but can't show a thousand
I ain't even want the bitch pussy
Cause the other day when I pop out got the hoes surrounding
Stop talking shit on them songs you a fake puncher
Russian bitch put a spell on me she my favorite runner
Love that drake' when I see the opps it sound just like thunder
Love that drank bitch I'm a rocky thats my favorite runner
I'll pay for a bitch nails and the bitch lean
Broke beggin bitch for some bread and some new kicks
She askеd am I new to the scams bitch I'm used to this
Forеign bitch only speak French she still suckin' dick
32 grams of opp nigga you smokin Reggie Duggie
Any time you see me in yo life I was 30 totin'
Girl be wanna fuck me she said she love me I don't do no hunchy
Bitch think I'm talmin' bout' boxing I got daily punches
Bitch wanna fuck she see me steppin' in these Off-Whites
Ate a wock nah fuck that shit I want the whole pint
Bitch know her head game crazy she my soul rider
I ain't had no percs or wock today I had a long night
[Verse 2: Punchmade Dev]
I bought my Draco customized it got a long knife
I been doing fraud from nine to five I had a long night
Seven grams in my backwood I don't smoke out pipes
If she don't hit this PNC for me she is not my type
When we fuckin wit' my chains on we don't need no lights
My shooter killed his last 3 targets he don't need no sight
My shooter out here hittin' everything
The police almost kicked me out the mall cause I'm grabbin' everything
Seven clones stuffed in my pocket I'm swiping everything
Send my shooter to a funeral home he like to bury things
Just gave my meth head a free sample I take care of my fiends
Exotic shoes only paid $900 for the pair on my feet
We the real turban trend setters we don't know no Yeat
Please do yo research on Punchmade we don't pay for these beats
We sit inside the crib hit jugs together we all gon' eat
Everybody made a band today before we brushed our teeth
Bitch
