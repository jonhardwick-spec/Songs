Lyrics from snippet
[Verse]
I don't wanna rap, I wanna bust plays (I don't)
I got a couple million to my name, I don't know why I'm rapping anyway
I can go dig in my safe right now (Right now) and pull out a quarter million any day (Let's go)
You might as well send all your money to me, I was gon' take it from you anyway (Gimme that)
Reach for that bitch, I guarantee you die
Nobody ever took a chain from me, I show it everyday when I'm online
I promise you're nowhere close to being me, you don't even got a car that you can drive
I know I'm going down in history 'cause I be torching shit when I'm online
Ya'll favorite rapper's running out of money
I got the proof right here, he going out sad, man, this shit starting to get ugly
I know what I'm doing ain't right, this shit bad, but I can't lie like I truly don't love it
Four million dollars, made that in a year, I still got some M's that I still ain't touched yet
You can't even bank that, I still ain't touched yet....
