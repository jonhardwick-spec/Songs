[Chorus]
You better not take a pic in them Diors because they not real
I won't take a sip unless I crack the seal
Your favorite scammer come to me for tips, I crack accounts forreal both eat in a game in six months, I bet I stack a mill
I taught my self how to scam, tripled up on everything you ever did with a pot and pan
Slide to the D with dumps and cards on me when I link with Bands (Bands world)
In Houston I've been courtside every game, I'm not a Rockets fan
[Verse]
Ever since I got the play in motion, I see a lot of hands. Pay attention, you can tell I'm rich by how I walk and stand
AMIRI four pockets full but I am not a fan, if he can get an aged bank account then tell him lock me in
I'm in the studio in my wocky stance, my bitch wouldn't let me use her bank I ain't talked to her since
The fans asked me to drop them a bin, I'd rather have you bring a bank account, and I'm dropping a ten
Got the whole Saks Fifth in my closet now
The fit cost five thousand or more when I'm walking out
It's time for new AMIRIs, I done blew all my pockets out, and these tight ass pockets but my Glock keep falling out
I'm finna drop a check, stand outside make sure you looking out
I want three thousand for a pack of
dumps
stop tryna talk me down
Cashapp banned me for the seventh time but still can't lock me out, I'm bougie as hell, pinkies up when I say wocky now
If her credit score suck, then that's a pointless ass convo
Ask them why they call me Punch, I hit the clerk with combos
How you talking like the plug inside a condo
Off of three lines of drank with every sip I see the time slow
Ratchet hoes don't get my attention, I fuck fine hoes
[Chorus]
You better not take a pic in them Diors because they not real
I
won't take a sip unless I crack the seal
Your favorite scammer come to me for tips, I crack accounts forreal both eat in a game in six months, I bet I stack a mill
I taught my self how to scam, tripled up on everything you ever did with a pot and pan
Slide to the D with dumps and cards on me when I link with Bands (Bands world)
In Houston I've been courtside every game, I'm not a Rockets fan
