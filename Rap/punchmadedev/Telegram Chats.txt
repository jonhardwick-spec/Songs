[Verse]
I'm in Telegram chats with the nerds, tryna increase my knowledgeI'm so glad I never went to college
If
cooking clones
and making
dumps
was legal I'd be a top scholar
I'm dressed in Givenchy, I'm looking rich, had to pop my collar
Just
jugged
a white kid with no remorse,
he was mentally slow
Thanks to Jake, I'm at the Rockets game been enjoying first row
I keep pouring up two pints a day, I've been physically slow
Both my bitches crazy, you won't catch me in pictures with hoes
I'm too player to kiss on these hoes
My shoes came with the LED lights on them, I'm doing the most
Them clothes look like they came from DHgate, you copped drip for the low
These are VVS diamonds on my wrist, not no pitiful gold
$50,000 in one year, that's a pitiful goal
When you see me empty out this ATM, take a flick when I pose
I play it smart, I put my
turban
on when I slip in the store
The neighbors think I'm selling drugs again, or I'm pimping out hoes
Or maybe I'm just doing both
Fuck them gun laws, in every city I'm taking my pole
If I catch him with his kids inside the mall, I won't stick to the codeBro was scared to box me one-on-one, then I pulled out my phoneI thought you said you was clutching in all of your songsBitched him out, made him turn around you wouldn't dare raise your toneCamping outside, I'm going to have my demon come follow you homeI know I'ma sleep better at night when your kids dead and gone
