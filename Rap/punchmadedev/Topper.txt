[Intro]
DevTakeFlight on the beat
Port Port Port Port Port Port
[Chorus]
Nigga get hit with the stick
He need a doctor
Thou must not lack on this block
You need a choppa
Got a bitch who fucking set you up 'cause you a oppa
Bitch want to fucking give me head 'cause she a topper
[Verse 1]
I just pushed her away
We don't say nothing about that
Niggas on my dick 'cause my name selling clout packs
I can't fuck with them 'cause niggas lame and I'm an outcast
Choppa lift him up off this Earth, triple bypass
Niggas play with yappas and my niggas nothing like that
Niggas talking hard and try to beef, but where his pipe at?
Nigga end up missing, but in Heaven where his life at
Just got off the porch and on this block
I'm gon' be right back
Yappa do the talking
D--D--Don't become a target
Y'all been on the spark shit
I leave 'em in the garden
Yappa feeling nauseous
That yappa get to fartin'
Don't make me bring the dogs out
That yappa get to barkin'
