Part I
[Intro: Dev's Ex]
Don't come with none of that Rara shit ’cause, nigga, I done heard all your songs like you saidNah, but long story short, I am looking to make moneyI'm a helpful asset, so if you willing to actually put your trust in somebody, knowing that you can't trust nobody in this world, let’s see what we can do
[Verse 1]
I'm finna make a clone (Come on), not go write a song
Once we get these gifties in the car, drive safe, let's make it home
(Let's go)
Let's take that risk and punch it out, we can hit store to store
I can teach you how to-, there ain't no need to dance from pole to pole
You got to play that role, walk in and gеt this loan
I've been fighting with this bitch for hours yelling through the phonе
Like bitch, "What you want?"
I'm finna send you in the store, you finna bust this clone (Come on), like, "Go
buy what you want"
Just send me all the pros
I’m using bitches for they bank, I ain’t fucking with hoes, quit trying to look through my phone (Broke bitch)
Just call this number, read the script, and then write down the code
You can't fuck it up, make sure you read all the steps that I wrote
Okay, I’m logged in (I'm in), let's go head up to Chase
She so fascinated with my play, she tryna give me brain
She going crazy with both hands, I'm swerving out my lane
Soon as she pull the five k out her Chase, I’m going in M.I.A (I'm gone)
[Bridge]
(
Why would I be hitting you up, when you could just sit here and play with me nigga?
