[Chorus: Punchmade Dev]
We ain't get him yet, but we gon catch him by surprise
Don't come out the house, I'm finna have my demons slide
Bullets fly inside the crib, we left the family petrified
I done wrote so many dumps, I got the last one memorized
Before I pull up always put on my disguise
That is not your Hellcat, go give that back to enterprise
We know you got that from the dealership
Teaching everybody how to punch I'm showing leadership
[Verse 1: Punchmade Dev]
If shе can't show at least hundred dollars, I'ma leavе this bitch
You better hope that car is bulletproof, I'ma crease that whip (Crazy)
One hundred K, I wanna see that shit
If I find out she stealing from me, I'ma beat that bitch (Stupid bitch)
How the fuck I got more hustle, I'm straight out the burbs
Honestly I never had to struggle, my bank never hurt
The opps is still working on a plan but it'll never work
Somehow I could pull out eighty thousand and I'll never work
She a real one, she gonna take me to my destination, I'ma split the pape' after I steal sum'
Here go a hundred dollars for the drive, go get a meal or sum
It was just a hundred dollars, now she on me trying to feel on sum (Back up, bitch)
[Chorus: Punchmade Dev]
We ain't get him yet, but we gon catch him by surprise
Don't come out the house, I'm finna have my demons slide
Bullets fly inside the crib, we left the family petrified
I done wrote so many dumps, I got the last one memorized
Before I pull up always put on my disguise
That is not your Hellcat, go give that back to enterprise
We know you got that from the dealership
Teaching everybody how to punch I'm showing leadership
