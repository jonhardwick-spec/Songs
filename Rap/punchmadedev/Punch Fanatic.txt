[Intro]
Nobody goes "wow he went to school"
Because anyone who follows the rules doesn't give a shit
Its all a scam its all a fucking lie
[Verse]
I got a brick of credit cards like I been card hopping for weeks
I got the secret recipe, Watch they jaw lock up for weeks
On the road, Tryna fight the wock I keep on falling asleep
I just pressed a super perk this gon make the tweakers tweak
Don’t walk around like you rich you only balled out for a week
My newest
Glock came with a glitch I pulled the trigger and it tweaked
Its time to find a newer bitch Her head game starting to get weak
I bet you move out from that crib, When I get the addy leaked
Way before I hit a piece, I was somewhere selling p's
Way before they made a trend, I was outside pushing p's
I Quit the trap to fully scam and did 50 my rookie week
I’m really rich, Not a peasant, You can't pay me for a feat
I'm sitting first class, I paid an extra thousand for this seat
I got my bitch mad, just left her on delivered for a week
I had to switch fast, replaced her with a new bitch for a week
She might stay here for a while if I cheat and she don't tweak
Exotic clothes, Exotic Bitches Living way Better Than Lavish
Exotic Poles, Exotic Switches, Everything came automatic
Everything come with a price, I want your life somewhere to grab it
You look nice wearing that ice until somebody come and snatch it
I get active, Grab a p, Then wrap it up and ship the package
I get active, Grab a piece and shop for free I make it happen
Did 250 in 3 weeks check my receipts I really have it
I got real cheese the type to get you killed while you in traffic (bitch)
