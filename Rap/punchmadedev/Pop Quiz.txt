Ay, ay

Devo
[Hook:]
She wanna come fuck with a boss
These niggas hatin’ but they stealin’ the sauce
I’m winnin’, I can’t take a loss
So I blew it back, give a fuck with the cops
Di-diamonds all over my chain
Devin, hey, we finna fuck with the gang
She fuckin’ on me for the fame
Now that I made it, they sayin’ I changed
[Verse 1:]
Catch him in New York, went straight to the top
Niggas hate me so I keep me a Glock
I’ma wear Gucci all over my socks
Can’t fuck with us then don’t talk to the cops
I ain’t duckin’ no nigga unless he a snitch
We gon’ catch him lackin’, leave him down in that ditch
They hatin’ on me, got me feelin’ like Chris
We gon’ slide down, smoke him like a zip
Devo with me totin’ sticks, choppa make his body flip
We gon’ empty out the clip
Shouldn’t be talkin’ all that shit
Never lackin’ keep a pole
Niggas love to play that role
Heard he dissin’ on the low
We gon’ pull up, let it blow
