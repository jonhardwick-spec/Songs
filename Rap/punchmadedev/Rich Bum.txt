[Chorus]
In and out your bitch crib
The neighbors thought this was the weed house
I could pull out eighty-thousand
And buy that Hellcat that you lease now
I'm like the white kid with allowance
I'm out here buying everything now
And I don't care, cuz this ain't my money
Load the mag and start dumping on him for tryna steal from me
Unemployments, back around again, how are you still bummy?
I'm a rich bum, sit inside the crib and steal people's money
[Verse]
*change sound*
If I'm not hearing that, then I won't touch my phone
Outta town, if I don't hit a bank, I won't come back home
Broke up with his bitch, now he ain't got a place to call his home
He was a football player, till I had my shooter crack his dome
Stay in the field, stop tryna play it like you like that
I'm in a different state with Glocks and MSRs, I'm living like that
Big Draco in the backseat of my car, why would I fight back?
Here go his social and his credit card, come get your life back
Somehow everything I do is free, I got a life hack
Somehow, everything you say is weak go give that mic back
Let him put his hands up, I'ma shoot him first, and then I'll fight back (Undefeated)
I always gotta have the upper hand
Send your first thousand straight to me, on god, I double bands
