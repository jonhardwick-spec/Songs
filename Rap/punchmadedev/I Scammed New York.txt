[Intro]
Could you fall victim to a sophisticated bank scam that begins with a simple text message?
Alpha
Freezy
The government says scams of all kinds are soaringAmericans report losing nearly eight-point-billion dollars
[Chorus: Punchmade Dev]
Drop a check in your Chase, I can make it happen
I was scammin' and juggin' before a rapper
Just hit a wire, I got a habit
I'm not sharin' the sauce, you can stick to trappin'
Plus I'm never lackin'
I hop out the V with a mil' in New York and I'm still pistol packin'
Just caught a package of Percocet pills on the fourth
Have them gone the next day like a hat trick (Come on)
I'm walkin' with Fentanyl pills in my baggage
I'm tryna catch me a kill, gеt it crackin'
I'll really shoot a bitch for being ratchet (Comе here)
If you got a BOA, bring it to me
'Cause I'm tryna bust a play, then hit Saks Fifth, then buy a brand new outfit for the free
[Verse 1: Punchmade Dev]
You still tryna find a way get the bag?
Lit on the 'Gram pretendin' to be me (Peasant)
You ain't even close to me, I just count up two hundred thousand in a week
The other day I had an attitude, I broke the money counter
This the seventh one this week
I can easily dox you, that's a simple task
I'ma be postin' the info for weeks (Haha)
You ain't richer than me, we can go rack for rack
If I took her from you, you ain't gettin' that back
I been punchin' for years, made a few couple million, it's time for a plaque
I'm tryna find out where Teejay been atHe used to like to talk a lot of shit, but y'all can see havin' a whirl with me will never last
