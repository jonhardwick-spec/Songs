[Verse]
I gotta punching addiction, I'm on my seventh keyboard this week
If we start beef Saturday, he won't see next week
My fiend shot up twelve times today, I know her neck weak
She warm the needle up inside my crib, that's her technique
Bro pulled out a hundred blues, that don't impress me
I got demons looking for my targets, it's a X week
Pulled up with some fake percs again, and told him test these
Why's he talking to my
MSR
, like "you sexy"
All my bitches got an attitude, I fuck with boujee hoes
Twenty thousand in a month i got that serving door to door
My Fendi coat hold my MAC-10, this my murder coat
Told this bitch she better not steal from me, cuz' I murder hoes
Stomp an opp out, his face flat, he got a turtle nose
The whole gang work at Walmart, y'all the Worker Bros
Kidnap a bitch and sell her pussy, I be working hoes
Just hit an ATM for seven hunnid', let me strike a pose
The police on my page, everytime the opps don't make it home
Apple working with the police now, I had to make a phone
Just bought a C4 from a Russian cop, then strapped it to a drone
When I called the jugg, I fixed my voice into a proper tone
"The payment didn't go through, you got to send it again"
I lied, I got the payment twice but I had to pretend
Send an opposition in the sky, had him gone with the wind
The second one wasn't really dead, so he tried to pretend
Little did he know we shoot dead bodies for fun
You don't get no respect from me if you die with a gun
That don't mean you own that Lamb truck, cuz' you driving in one
Everytime my killer lose his strap, I supply him with one
... That's cap, I supply him with two
Headshots run inside his blood, I ain't train him to shoot
