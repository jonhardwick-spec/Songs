[Intro]
(
Ooh, EXACTLY
)
[Verse]
I'm scared to show my face in the mall because I punched it out (Punch, punch)
I want a bunch of credit cards, you want a bunch of clout
I got seven members hittin' banks, they on different routes
I dropped a fake ID on the floor and they kicked me out
I'm a king, when I die, I'm gon' get mummified
I would've never died in Buffalo, I'd bring the gun inside
If you died, you're a fuckin' botIf you die in a school shooting, you're a fuckin' bot
Why the fuck did you sit there?
I hate Lexington, but I can't lie, I got rich herе
Flood the city with them fake pills, hit a lick hеreWith Percs, Xanny bars, and ecstasies, I had a big yearI feel bad 'cause half of them pills had fentanylSike, a few people died, I don't care at all
Don't be surprised, I'll scam a retard, I need it all (Give me that)Cut this bitch off, she caught cancer and she went baldIt is what it is
Put some money on your head, they gon' spin, split a wig (Come here)
Walmart was finna close, I had to punch for the win (Punch, punch)
Senior year, I was slappin', I had a bunch of them bins
Told myself, when I get rich, I'ma stay humble
But that ain't last long,
I had to up a couple
I should stop flexin' on the 'Gram to keep me out of trouble
I know the feds lookin' at my 'Gram like, "We on to somethin'" (I don't care)
But I ain't worried 'bout it, I ain't leave a trail
I ain't trippin', I could pay a quarter-million-dollar bail
I'ma say I'm from the suburbs, I don't belong in cells
Watch me get out the same day and I won't have to tell
