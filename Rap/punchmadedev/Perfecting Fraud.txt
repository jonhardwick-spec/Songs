[Chorus]
I ran up some real dog shit off of fraud
Y'all ass still tryna get signed
You need to go talk to your Jeweler that chain look cheap and on God that bitch don't shine
Who wearing that moissanite watch
It's obviously fake AP don't even make that kind
I'm perfecting my craft, the checks that I make look good
Each one I been taking my time
I'm in the urus right now with a switch on me I be moving so risky
I gotta ride around with extra clips on me one click and its empty
Yo bitch looking dingy as hell she shop at Shein, mine just signed with Balenci
I'm finna fly to Kentucky right now who got a chase? let's link and get busy
[Verse]
Im the most turnt in the city I can show millions niggas can't show fifty
Half of the city be mad then a bitch cause I won't put them on and they can't get with me
Niggas upping a ten I can pull out plenty
Get a section eight crib your life looks shitty
He tried to run down the street, but he wasn't so fast niggas got did like (Rickyyy)
Face first down he got left in the street
I get niggas clapped one button delete
Now his family heartbroken they can't even eat
We the main reason y'all ass using them feet
I'm rich and untouched this shit so smooth
Take a look at the chain on my neck it took one play for you that's five hundred weeks
