[Intro]
Lexington police don't have much to work with in the murder of ****An arrest won't bring the 18-year old back, but a call to Crimestoppers could mean justice
[Chorus]
I love steppers, the steppers love me
When I need somebody ****, this on the house, it's all free
I knew his ass was dead before the news announced him as deceased
And I can troll because I got his killer standin' next to me
We play real-life GTA, get up close and press delete
I'd probably do a hundred years if 12 flicked me in this V
I got a mansion in the 'burbs, but I make millions in the streets
I'm the richest in my city, Lexington belong to me
[Verse]
That's the quickest way to get sent straight to God
Fresh fit, fresh cut, topped off with a suit & tie
I wasn't there, but I could tell you every detail how he died
Go grab a gun, put on your mask, jump in the whip, and go and slide
I got CPL but I still ride with switches on my Glocks
I hope **** almost know his time is up, he's on the clockHe went broke and sold his jewelry, I got super poor ass opp's
He's in his songs, braggin' 'bout a 20-ball, that's not a lot
He was actin' like a killer on the 'gram, now he's a caption
I get love inside the trenches, it was free when they just whacked him
He was postin' with that chain, but disappeared after they snatched it
You ain't getback for your homie or your chain, go get active
It ain't hard to find me, I'm in the red urus in traffic
Glock 19 with a button, come play with me while in traffic
I'm punchin' phones, grabbin' giffies, doin' swaps, and I'm trappin'
Ain't nobody Punch K, playin' with that, come in caskets
