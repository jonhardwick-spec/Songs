Davie on my side, so I don't got to bring the strap
Bought an embosser started swiping
I don't ever got to trap
I'm outta breathe from paper chasing, I done ran a thousand laps
I done learned my lesson once, I'll never give a bitch my last
I had to get it on my own, 'cause they ain't never had my back
I'll make a band for every nigga that was laughing in my past
These hating niggas said I'll never make it now look where I'm at
And I got rich in just a year somehow your pockets is still flat
Niggas really out here jealous that's a pussy nigga trait
These rappers really out here telling, they a goofy and a fake
I see you pocket watching nigga, trying to find out what I make
And if we smoked them then we meant that we don't ever make mistakes
[Verse]
We will slide down and take a nigga ice like we love to skate
Niggas who don't like me they be broke, so I love the hate
I will scam a nigga give back to the homeless on another day
When they burn these methods I'll go and find another way
This bitch just called be broke, I paid a band to get her out the way
I can never work a 9-to-5, I make that everyday
Flexing like he got it we gonna slide each and every way
That nigga sent his mommas card, but I scammed him anyway
These niggas out here walking in the mall empty handed
I can never love a bitch again my heart already damaged
Cross me once and that's your last, so don't ask where we standing
I thank God it could be worse I'll never take this shit for granted
Niggas out here flexing with a strap with empty pockets
I'll never give a bitch my heart again and that's a promise
I got bands all in my jeans, so I be limping while I'm walking
Everytime they burn a method, there is a new one and I'm on it
