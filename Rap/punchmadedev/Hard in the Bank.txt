[Chorus]
I go hard every time I step foot in the bank (On God)
I'm hated by half of the industry, pay for a feature, I'm takin' that pape'
It's mine, thank you
I put the money right into my pocket and go 'bout my day (Give me that)
I could care less 'bout a broke-ass rapper who jealous and wanna be me anyway
Who wouldn't wanna be me for a day? Who wouldn't wanna wear these for a day? (Who?)
You're goin' broke and that's not okay
It's a good day not to be you, you're poor, you sit at the crib makin' music for days
[Verse]
Look, this money I'm holdin' ain't come from the trapAnd on God, none of this came from rap
On God, y'all never gettin' this back
If I took somethin' from you, comeâ€”
If I took somethin' from you, come find me, let's have a shootout about it
Every day, I get a new death threat, I'm tryna see who gon' do somethin' about it
Ha, you're sittin' at home watchin' me count it
[Chorus]
I go hard every time I step foot in the bank (On God)
I'm hated by half of the industry, pay for a feature, I'm takin' that pape' (Hated)
It's mine, thank you
I put the money right into my pocket and go 'bout my day
I could care less 'bout a broke-ass rapper who jealous and wanna be me anyway
Who wouldn't wanna be me for a day? Who wouldn't wanna wear these for a day?
You're goin' broke and that's not okay
It's a good day not to be you, you're poor, you sit at the crib makin' music for days
