Dxnte, you snapped on this one
Punchmade Dev is nothing more than a fucking scumbag who sits at home and steals innocent people's moneyAnd y'all sit here and support him, patheticNo wonder why y'all are stuck in The Matrix
[Chorus]
I'm not sharin' my banks, I ain't sharin' the sauce, over here, I be hoggin' the plays (Let's go)
I might lie to you like we splitting fifty-fifty, but really, I'm keeping the pape' (That's cash, baby)
I got a million dollars, and I'm still in the city outside with my face (Every day)
I'm still busting wires while I'm in Chicago, but I fly to Houston to pick up the pape'
They done pissed me off, now I gotta go and clap the CEO of BOA (Come here, damn)
Turn on the switch and hit him with the Drac'
He don't wanna come outside, that's okay (Okay, that's fine)
He don't wanna come outside, that's okay, we gon' sit on the low and clap it up for days (He can't hide)
[Verse]
I've been spinning back-to-back, dropping checks, hitting wires out of BOA (Every day)
I made a million dollars off of bank fraud, it's only right I put it on a chain (On God)
I know the banks hate me, BOA mad, they tryna come and sue me for a chain
I ain't gon' never take this bitch off (Never)
You gon' have to snatch it off or change the name (Come take it)
I'ma be hitting plays, I'll never stop
Ain't nothin' changed since I got a name
Ain't nothin' changed since I got fame 'cause I'll still somebody for my chain (Try it)
I'll get you clapped for being in the way
I'm still sellin' fake pills inside the state (On God)
Under the filed taxes in my name, the feds will never see 'em, nor the bread I make
