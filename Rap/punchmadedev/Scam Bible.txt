[Verse 1]
Four, five, six, three, six, seven, zero
Love making dumps? Then go type in that
BIN
If you tryna make the most, then you can't tell your friends
And don't click on purchase without VPN
But don't buy a card, go get you a dump
Made a hundred thousand in just less than a month
Make your way down to Walmart and walk in the front
Scout out your surroundings, you might have to run
Hit electronics, they all in the back
Then go get the biggest TV off the rack
Don't be all suspicious and keep looking back
You wanna move like you got it like that
Walk up to the clerk and make sure you polite
You wanna seem rich, so you gotta talk white
You wanna flex on them niggas tonight
So go on, cash out on those items tonight
Now I'ma teach you to swipe online
Just make sure you're swipin' real late at night
Take all their money and leave them to cry
When they call up the bank, its gon' look like they lied
Go get a social and sign up for credit
This method still works, I done got like seven
I'm spendin' free money, I'm livin' in Heaven
Just listen close, I'ma give you some methods
When you get a card, put it on Google Pay
Make two fake accounts, or get locked up today
With that social you bought, go find out where they stay
If it's wrong when you send it, it's gon' be delayed
When the money go through, transfer that to a bank
And then go to a ATM with a new blank
If you got a whip, then go swipe out of state
When I hit the road, I come back with like eight
Then use the same card and go load up eBay
Go order iPhones and then get 'em next day
Then go to the pawn if you tryna get paid
I did this three times, twenty bands what I made
Sign up for Stripe and then say you do hair
They gon' send you a reader to swipe it on there
You barely get banned, if you do, then that's rare
VPN on my phone, so the feds don't know where
Congratulations, you learned how to swipe
Go get proxy servers and stay out of sight
Bluetooth MSR, its gon' read it and write
Finna get y'all some BINs so your card won't declineFour, three, four, seven, six, nine, zeroFour, two, three, three, two, zeroFour, eight, six, seven, nine, six, zeroFour, two, four, zero, six, eight, zero
