Come on
[Verse]
Let me tell y'all about the day I almost took an L
I grabbed a fire dump from my site, this one not gon' fail
Lately, I've been hitting ATMs, I'm not fucking with mail
Lately, I've been using Bitcoin, I'm not fucking with Zelle
(fuck zelle)
My Face card hot, I only pop out at night
Real late, I'm talking 4AM when I popped out this time
Don't park the whip when you get close, stop the car right outside
Take a left, then the first right at the second stop sign
Okay, I think we here
I'ma hop out with this piece, you can stay right hеre
I'm not familiar with this side of town, this my first day herе
But I'm still comfortable, this like my 700th play this year
It's not a lie no more when I tell y'all I got rich right here
I opened up the door and seen the ATM sitting right there
Took my card out, I'm finna empty this Chase right here
A minute passed, I hear somebody creeping with both of my ears (Fuck is that?)
I'm like, hold on, what's that
Somebody walking around the corner with gloves and a mask
I'm confused bout what's finna go down, I was drunk for a fact
He came walking towards me, I grabbed pole and then took a step back
Then another one popped out with Drac' and then upped in my face
I didn't hesitate I upped my pole, started bussing they way
Both of them tried to run, only one got away
He's so lucky that my Glock jammed, I was aiming for face
I was traumatized couldn't go to sleep, I just **** somebody
I can't lie, was fucking with my head, I shoulda caught that ****
I might be a kid from the burbs' but I **** somebody
I came close to a mill off fraud, rocks and Molly
Who's the reason why your brother walking round in crutches?
Next time tell him to shoot me if he chooses to up it
Because if you don't, I'll do the same thing and pop him in public
You could have had me killed a week ago, but I always tuck it
