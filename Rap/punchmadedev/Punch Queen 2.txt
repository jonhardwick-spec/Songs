Hey baby
Uh, it’s me
I miss you a lot, and I miss hearing your voice
[Verse]
She a punch queen, she gon’ sign my check when she get here (Yeah)
She do everything I say, that’s why I love to have her here
I can count on her to keep it solid when thеy offer years
I can count on her to watch ovеr my crib when I ain’t there
Me and you a crazy duo when we scam, it ain’t fair (Uh)
When I hit the play, you always call the bank, make sure it’s there
She a real bitch, I take the full profit, and she don’t care
Not too many hoes gon’ hold it down for you when you ain’t there
Bring me banks and hold it down, and I’ma keep them hoes from here
I like how you give me space to work and build up my career
I like how you stuck with me when I been cheatin’ for a year
That’s expected, I’m a legend where I’m from, the highest tier (Legend)
I gotta give some credit to my other bitch
You knew exactly who my bitch is, you ain’t never thought to snitch
I do you bad, and you ain’t never thought to switch
I can’t forget the time you bought my bitch a brand new pair of kicks
I played it off like I bought it myself, I’m super slick
I like the fact that you ain’t never trippin’ over stupid shit
And you be comin’ to my phone with super licks
You so grimey, I done saved yo’ number under “Wicked Bitch”
I can’t lie to heaven, you ain’t never missed
When I need somebody ****, you helped me scratch them off the list
You helped me set the play on ****, a week after he dropped the diss
And then a week later, we pulled up to his grave to take a pic (Rest in piss)
