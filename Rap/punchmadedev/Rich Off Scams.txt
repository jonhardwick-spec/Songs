Codeine, pour me up

[Chorus]
I don't wanna rap, I wanna bust plays (I don't)
I got a couple million to my name
I don't know why I'm rappin' anyway
I can go dig out my safe right now (Right now)
To pull out a quarter million any day (That's true)
You might as well send all your money to me (Come here)
I was gon' take it from you anyway (Give me that)
Reach for that bitch, I guarantee you die
Nobody ever took a chain from me, I show it every day when I'm on live
I promise you're nowhere close to bein' me, you don't even got a car that you could drive
I know I'm goin' down in history 'cause I be torchin' shit when I'm online
[Verse]
Y'all favorite rappеr's runnin' out of money
I got the proof right herе, he goin' out sad, man, this shit startin' to get ugly
I know what I'm doin' ain't right, this shit bad, but I can't lie like I truly don't love it
Four million dollars, made that in a year, I still got some M's that I still ain't touched yet
You can't name a bank that I still ain't touched yet (Nope)
This shit don't make sense, how I be scammin' everybody and still ain't get touched yet? (How?)
I'm disappointed, I be outside with a pole just fiendin' for somethin' to bust at
If I ever took some money from you and you see me out, let's just have a team deathmatch
