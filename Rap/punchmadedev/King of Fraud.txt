[Intro: News Report]
They tracked the crimes back to May of 2017 (
CashMoneyAP!
)
And often the self-described, "Greatest Swiper of All Time"
Stolen Bank ID numbers were also apart of the alleged crimes
Investigators say that tracking cash on Social Media was not hard
[Hook]
We hit the road with them cards in the back
We come back with phones, so we cash out
Racks in our pocket, we walk in and spendin' at Saks
I done been broke once
No, I ain't YoungBoy
But, I know I never could ever go back
They say I couldn't but I went and did that
And now I'm on top, and it's makin' 'em mad
I hear all the hate, I just sit there and laugh
You sittin' at home, and you mad that you ain't makin' no money
Shit, get off your ass and go try that
I know what I would do, if some goof came and snatched my chain, 'cause nobody tried that
We heard them nigga's is out here, just rappin'
Like they out here killin', they seen, and ain't slide yet
Nigga's be, duckin', and hidin'
They poppin' outside
I don't think they ready to die yet
[Verse]
I don't wanna buy it, so I'ma go punch it
You say you punchin', embossin' them cards
You ain't even touch it
Look at my closet, you see Neimann Marcus
I'm not from Detroit, but nigga I'm thrustin'
I blew up off scammin', I can't get a deal
They know what I'm on
They said, "We can't trust him"
My manager know, when they send the advance
And the money go through, then I'm just finna cut 'em
Ain't nobody safe, I'm not finna pay for this beat
That goofy ass nigga got scammed
I won't even pay for the video
Shot for an hour, he gave me the camera, I ran
I had a meeting, I flew to Atlanta
And reached in his pocket, while shaking his hand
3797-2082-2352-2004
I went to the bank to check on his balance
I put in his card and that nigga had bands
Label's say they wanna work, and they pay for my flight
I'ma block 'em as soon as I land
How you gon' get scammed, and listen to all of my songs?
I really just don't understand
I'ma just keep scammin' all of these nigga's
The only one's safe is all of my fans
