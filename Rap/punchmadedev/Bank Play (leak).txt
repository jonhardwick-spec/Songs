[Verse]
Soon as I open up my eyes I hit a Bank Play
I know someone who work behind the counter I hit the same play (too easy)
And thats why I love Chase
Hit the drive-thru window
When I leave put on my dub face
All my checks hit for ten or more, we dont cook up the same
They hit (*bleep) hit his head, almost took off his face (come here)
I know that bullet fucked up his brain
I think I would've matched with Lil head and wear my opps chain (shh)
Then act like its mine and take a picture with it
I know y'all seen what happеned in that mall I should've pistol whipped him
Hе's just lucky that his kids was with him
My shooter dont care, next time we gon shoot you with him
When I say its up there's no reversing that
I paid for that (*bleep) you should come and get that murder bag
Its time for you to quit that job you working at
Just put a price on you, thats gon be the spot they lurking at
Go pick up (*bleep) he a lil dead
About a week ago his Baby moms gave me a lil head
Im in the living room, playing 2k while she twist my dreads
His son call me daddy so when I leave I grip him by his head
