So I was just hoping that maybe you would talk to me sometime soon because I-, how do I say it, might move on with stuff, cuz like' you closed my bank account out and, you owe me little bit of money, and now I settle that, so I-
[Verse]
I woke up pissed off
Last night my bitch caught an attitude so now she cut off
That’s okay, I found a better bitch, we lay low and duck off
When my old one double back, I'ma text her ass like "Fuck off" (Bitch)
It's over with, I can’t see you no more
My new bitch pretty in the face, I don't need you no more
I bet I'd never make the same mistake fucking round' with a whore
I bet I'd never make the same mistake sending you in the store
I told you not to drop a check in there, but you did it of course
So this one really ain't my fault
But if we being real, we both know it's never my fault We can hit these bank accounts together, and never fall off
I'm really him, for real, we both know I’m not the one to lose
My whole roster top tier, it make it hard for me to choose
Why would I stick to one bitch, when I really want two?
I don’t care who you fucking with now, cuz' I’m richer than dude
I made twenty thousand five times before I stepped in the booth
If I ain't have a source of income, I'd probably hate on me too
My new bitch a punch queen, she done swiped me some shoes
She know I got a love for fake checks, she gon' bring me the food
Soo? You will call me back or text me or like.. something
