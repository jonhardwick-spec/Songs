[Intro]
Yo Instagram got deleted, man
Yes, sir. Probably about, like, four months ago
Man, you know what I'm saying you was out the way for a minute
So, like, what you've been doing in between time
Really living life without it, you feel me
[Verse]
Lately I've been feeling like I'm running from the feds
It might be time to hang it up. It's fucking with my head
I can't quit now, ima sip a line and push a head
I want a opp down scoot up on him and push off his head
If I didn't take that risk, I wouldn't be so ahead
If it wasn't for them fiends, I probably would be broke instead who going to keep a solid for me if I get locked inside the feds Who going to catch a kill for me when I put money on they head
They gonna do a drill for me, I set a price, enough was said
Make it happen in a day or less, I'll cut you twice the check (On god)
(Yo Instagram got deleted, man)
I could press a Perc 30 and sell it quick when touch down to Lex
That fast money make it hard for me to not go flex
You a crash dummy if you run up reaching for my neck
I already popped him once, who gonna be next
Imagine doing fraud and selling ***** ,I'm here to picture that
You work a 9 to 5, ain't trying to take a risk, so stick to thatYou'll never catch me in the club, I'm way too rich for that
You'll never catch me getting pressed, I always got my stick attached
When I take down yo instagram, you'll never get it back
(Yo Instagram got deleted, man)
Cause when I send them, they gonna get it done
There ain't no spinning back
I forgot that he was dead
I was confused why he ain't text me back
You let a grown man take your gun go get your pistol back
(Living life without it, you feel me)
