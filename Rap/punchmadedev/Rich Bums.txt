[Intro]
We rich bums our money came from (come on)
[Chorus]
We rich bums our money came from ***** I can't get us indicted
Rich fiends keep blowing up my phone ‘cause I know where a pint is
Leave that chain inside the crib it don’t hit in the lighting
He thought he was getting off in Gucci, they made that in China
[Verse]
In a different state with MSRs and Glocks I can’t get caught in traffic
They keep asking me how I got rich I said “credit card magic”
I'm boosting credit scores from my computer I know a few hat tricks
Rich nugs filled in my Al Capones I don’t smoke out of dab pens
In other words you’re a peasant to mе (poor)
Won’t catch me smoking out a Ziploc bag don’t even pass that to mе (Never)
I can tell a lie straight to the clerk where’s my acting degree?
I know there’s fentanyl inside these pills but I’m packaging these
6 months ago I used to ride with bows in my passenger seat
I ain’t quit the trap, I just pay people to slap it for me
If you ever see me out in public, there was racks in my jeans
You can’t see the blick, but on my soul it was packed underneath
He hit that backdoor on my mans and got packed underneath
How does it feel to find your closest friend face first in the street?
I’ll take it there, put twenty on your head over lil petty beef
I bet they can tell you how I’m from the ‘burbs but got rich off the streets
Now I’m living the hood nigga dream
Spent twenty-seven thousand on a watch, then a thousand on lean
Pure VVS stones in my ear, I paid thousands for these
My jeans say Mike Amiri on ‘em, It’s a thousand for these
