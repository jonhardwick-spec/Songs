[Intro]
Punchmade DevHey, what was that one song we listened to in the car?And it went like
[Chorus]
You bust plays for twenty dollars, that is not a jugg
Where I live, I got a gate code, this is not the hood (I'm in the 'burbs)
Fuck a Draco, this the AK with the real wood
Put that strap down and retire, your aim is not good (Deadass)
He was right in front of you, how you miss that? (How you miss?)
I got every brand inside my closet, can't even mismatch
I got a ten-round magazine for that six-pack (Okay)
Quit bitching on your Snap' story, get that lick back (Cut it out)
[Verse]
We don't wanna see you post about it (We don't)
Up a hundred K, they don't wanna see me boast about it (Haters)
For a play, I'll go and do the most about it (I'll do the most)
Get a opp killed, then sit around and have a toast about it (Come on)Like, let's talk about who we gon' kill next
Box him in while he driving home, then kill him like he X
I'm for sure the richest puncher (On God) that came out of Lex'
Never have I had a runner (Nope), I'm who drop the checks (Bitch)
Welcome to my jugg school, come and take a test (Come on)
Cooking 201s in the lab, fuck a
Johnny Test
Three different guns on my body, fuck who tryna step
We got thirty rounds in our clip, who the fuck is Steph? (Fuck is Steph?)
Fah, fah, fah, we gon' shoot until nobody left
Here go a fiend coming for the rest (Come on)
I don't know why he came back again, that was some fake Tec'
Lined him up like his barber would and push his shit back (Come here)
