[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
Fuck, huh, shit, damn, huh
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Shooter Super Saiyan, he'll pop you like a Senzu Bean
Brodie OT road running, he a rental fiend (Whew)
Bitch, I'm charged up (Brr), shit, times two
Feel like Mac and Devin, I was blowed back in high school
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Tryna fight like Gohan? We'll blow him like some hot food
Found out she was fucking, that shit hurt him like a tattoo
She suck it and leave it a mess, she like a messy eater
You only paid me for the method, not to be a teacher
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Catch yo baby, we gon' hit him in his Cocomelon
We be loading Glockiеs, y'all be going to the popo, telling
Say hе got some demons? He don't know no felons
We ain't got no manners, hunnid dollar plates at Fogo, yelling
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
We gon' knock you down in .2 if you show your weapon
Shot his legs off for being tough, it ain't no more stepping
Hit the club and I'll start a storm like the Crooked Man
Three of Wocky shut my body down like I took a Xan'
