[Intro]
(You're not making this easy, Kyle)
Leaving out for school, headphones in the bag
Mapping out a plan that every play get split in half
Leaving out for school, headphones in the bag
Bitch
[Verse 1]
Leaving out for school, headphones in the bag
2017, was getting to it, skipping class
Mapping out a plan that every play get split in half
Half in the stash and half in the scams
Or going masked up or break a slab and the grams
Only a few ways that you can live where I'm from
Where I'm at in life, it's hard to get where I'm from
"Mama, there he go", I motivate the kids whеre I'm from
2019, I dropped Bin Reapеr, they was sleepingPitchfork rated it a seven, they was tweaking
2020, seemed like all my haters, they was peakingBut that's unemployment for you, I ain't think that they was eating
Same year, I hit a new gear, I switched modes
But I can't break the code, I can't switch teams
S-what-to the DSM, I'm throwing big B's
BabyTron, StanWill, TrDee, the big three
Lando took a chance on us and everybody laughed
Now it's 2022 and everybody mad
'Cause if you want a verse now then it cost twenty
Whoever counted gang out, shit, they all dummies
Rolling Stone, XXL, the next thing Forbes
How you even worried 'bout my battle with a clean sword? (How)
Almost sent an SOS but then I seen shore
When you die, it ain't no waking up, fuck I'ma sleep for?
Hit him with that Porter's X2, now he a particle
I don't rap battle, forty weapons in my arsenal
He a clown trusting hoes, someone get him to the carnival
Helmut Lang
,
Warren Lotas
, walking out looking remarkable
Water like the Gulf of Mexico, watch how the Cuban hang
Fuck an arm and leg, I
paid a body for this Human Made
I was in the field for real while you was doing two a day
Locked in with money, I been staying out of Cupid range
Turkey Man busting down the 'bows
Riding right next to him, shipping out a load
Mauri, MJ, and Fordi tripping with the Pro's
Whipping what's it called with what's his name, we in the store
I'm on a different magnitude, I maxed out my attributes
Keep your two cents 'cause I don't ever remember asking you
Told her, "Quit the attitude", she gon' get a bag or two
Supreme dripping off my T-shirt, this not Thrasher, dude
The dumbest shit to do is compare me to you
The dumbest shit to do is comparing us to them
Like I don't know a team could match up
Rafael Nadal, bitch, I'm racked up
Letterman say Saint Laurent, look like I play for Varsity
'Fore I let you get a 'Wood, I gotta grab the darkest leaf
Quick to have you looking crazy, don't you even start with me
Your bitch wake up early, brush her teeth then she gargle me
