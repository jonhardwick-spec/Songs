[Verse]
Hey, today's plans include flexin', I can't hold it off (Woo)
Wake up, roll a log, that's my protocol
When it rains, it's gon' pour, when it snow, it falls (Boom)
Y'all ain't got no game plan, get the coach involved
I'll buy a 'bow, then turn it into smoke and fog
Actin' like your recipe OG, that's some stolen sauce
Closet full of drip, it's lookin' like I went and stole the mall
Ridin' with the load, the mission is to drop it off
Shit, I'm flyin' up the road and I don't plan on hoppin' off
Score a pint and pour, pour, pour, catch me noddin' off
Actin' tough, you a ho, ho, ho, knock it off
Feel like Santa Claus, I might just come down through your chimney (Hahahaha)
Boy, my shooter, he a hunter, he gon' do the Lindsey (Nyah)
Walked out, diamonds H2O, you think my jeweler rinsed mе (Whew)
In the O, Toledo to Dayton, wе flew through Findlay (Skrrt)
You got little green, Hornswoggle, step in, make the floor wobble
If we in the club, we buy the ones and get the whores bottles
Two-seater, four models, three-five, Perc' 10s
TRX done turned the street to gravel, watch me earth-bend
[Chorus]
Sold-out dates, shit, I'm goin' on a hundred shows
Bust the kit down, shit, I should've copped a hundred 'bows
When I made my first hundred K, needed a hundred more (Swear)And a hundred more (Swear) and a hundred more (Swear)And a hundred more (Swear) and a hundred more (Swear)And a hundred more (Swear) and a hundred more (Swear)And a hundred more (Fuck), that's an M, ain't it?Math ain't mathin', shit, I'm waitin' on my tenth payment
