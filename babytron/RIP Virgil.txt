[Intro]
Ayo, Mark A
Huh
[Verse]
Glock 23 give his ass the Chris Mullin cut
Let me see that pint, your Wock' funny, boy, I shook it up
Star in the car, I see stars when I'm lookin' up
Scampire, double coffee-cup, this bitch full of blood
Got a play out the way, I gotta hit Lavonia
Hit the turtle pie winter time, I might get Pneumonia
Unkie masked up, actin' like he finna get Corona
Brodie off a six of Wocky, lookin' like he sippin' Cola
He gon' end up in a coma
Three stripes, off the three-fifties, I ain't in Samosas
Talkin' 'bout you trap, but never seen the yola hit the sola
Lil' gang bad as hell, they'll never get diplomas
3-5 off—, shit, where the fuck am I at, dude?
Balеnciaga addict, middle name should be "Track 2"
Wеnt and grabbed a fast coupe, bitch, I had to
Act rude, fifties in my pants, but the stash blue
Flyin' down Evergreen, I got the chop wit' me
Y'all the seventh seed, first seed, I got a squad wit' me
I ain't sellin' beans, I be punchin, but can't box wit' me
Trackhawk
got hella speed, be damned the cops get me
Bitch, I came a long way from them giffy trips
Goin' wit' my gut, I ain't dealin' wit' the iffy shit
Don't cost it, but I payed my hitman a fifty-strip
Whole faucet, got it outta Hutch, bitch, Jimmy lit
Off-White 5s on my feet, R.I.P. Virgil
Blue, green and pink money, bitch, but the jeans Purple
Movin' slow off the red, I don't drink turtle
Two straps, walkin' in your crib like I'm Steve Urkel
ROYGBIV, cup got a lot of R in it
Widebody, I'm too damn high, I can't park in it
Akhi slidin' down, sendin' shots like he bartendin'
Feel like Yeat, ridin' wit' my twizzy in my scarf drippin
'
Ridin' in a spaceship, might land on Mars wit' me
Ain't scared of shit, bein' smart, got my car tinted
Chrome tee, but my chest ain't got a heart in it
Rapstar, 2018 I had carbs hittin'
2022 I need ten for the verse
Timbos on, Unkie in here steppin' on the work
Eleven on the kicks, seven on the shirt
Reach for a chain, send his ass to heaven in a hearse
3-5, 3-5, shit, I'm lookin' Asian
Hit his ass wit' a headshot, doggie should have Matrix-d
Fifteenth wood of the day, shit, I couldn't face it
So much cap on his mixtape, shit, I couldn't play it
Buffs wit' the ice chucks, I gotta blow my nose
I ain't basic, walked up into Hutch, I had to rose the gold
March 2020, would've lost, we went pro for pro
Winter 21', you gon' lose, we go coat for coat
2022 I might fuck around and get a Grammy
Shitty Boyz meetin', hit up Dee, gotta hit up Stan
Newest gen' Glock, dumbass, even the pistol fancy
Cryin' on Instagram, boy, you need to fix your pennies
SSNs layin' 'round, I can get your grammies
We might firebomb your crib if we get your addy
I might come, big Rolls Royce, I can't get no Chevy
.762s flyin' out, we'll flip your scatty
