[Intro]
We all getting high
It's just a geek day
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
Long live the PA prince
V cuts, shrooms 'round, and we
V cuts, shrooms 'round
[Verse 1]
V cuts, shrooms 'round, Fordi pouring Stilpane
The worth on your watch ain't going up, like why it still plain?
High as hell where the heels hang, I don't spill drank
Bank account could look like Bill Gates and they would still hate
He in that '03 like he Greedo, his car gon' implode
Got a worker at the store, I can't go hit Target 'til four
He be tellin' fairy tales, we skippin' his part on the song
Psilocybin got me bouncin' 'round, I'm in Mario Mode
Vlone hoodie on my back, this ain't Barry no more
Tryna run a marathon with us? Boost your cardio, bro
Icicles, forty pointers, just filled my Cartis with snow
Bitch, it's the Militia, thousands shots when the army unload
Threw that fake shit on your body thinkin' we hardly would know?
But we peeped it, boy, you not slick
Let an out-of-towner try and put his on FOX-6
I went from undrafted to the top pick
Only way them fuckers findin' out if God snitch
Think I'm lackin' off the server, ever seen a Glock glitch?
Unkie take a—, it make a ki' like a locksmith
Outfit, it's a masterpiece, I walk around and drop drip
Thousand dollar jeans, to get these, you gotta shoplift
Life a gamble, back to back 7s, Luka Trončić
Before you make decisions, sit and listen to your conscience
Think he got an open bucket, gon' LaTron it
