[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Reuel, stop playing with these niggas
)
Ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I think this lil' stripper wanna fuck ’cause I tipped her good
Bitch wigging, I'ma get her gone like the Timberwolves
On the phone with Benihana's, make sure that my shrimp is cooked
Stepping in Balenciagas, bitch, I’m really him, just look
Bitch, I'm him, like really him, it ain't no duplication
Flexing like a jock but it's N.E.R.D. on my Human Races
Riding with the Drac' and the Glock, it ain't new they hatin'
It ain't them F’s on my tests but I still got that stupid paper
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Threesome in the room with yo bitch and my Glocky on me
Called a ham but he sent thе pape’ and I stopped responding
Wish hе would, my bitch upping stick but I'm not with Wanda
Old hoes calling ’cause I'm up, bitch, I'm not rewinding
Caught him in some Comme des, the Glock gave him heartburn
They don't need no GPS, the bitches know it’s our turn
Had to tell this bitch, "Before you slide, jam the card first"
Low tops with the splatter on 'em, stepping in some artwork
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
I was big tripping, let a bitch tear my heart out
She really losing now, broke as hell and her car loud
How the fuck y'all got a point for in a dark stout?
Something like I'm SpongeBob neighbor, I'm a star now
If you felt what I felt, you'd still be throwing up
Computer new as hell, they like, "How the fuck you loading up?"
Where they selling army tanks at? I'ma tryna blow 'em up
Two sticks, give him twenty-one, give that controller up
