Shit, hella miles on the rental tryna pull loads
I was taught to play it cool all up in the stores
I told Fordi swing the fifty, we do given goalsThis shit too strong, don't use the Magic Bullet, they'll overdose
Codeine probably damagin' my kidneys, still sip some more
I took the money I made off a tenthy, went and bought a coat
I keep it 'round for the load, my unky still play with dope
Duckin' the alphabets, servin' X and O's
Hella miles on the rental tryna pull loads
I was taught to play it cool all up in the stores
I told Fordi swing the fifty, we do given goalsThis shit too strong, don't use the Magic Bullet, they'll overdose

Swing the chopper like a bat and knock you out the park
Doggy talkin' 'bout that he be ballin', but don't even start
Eight-seventy-five for my shoes, yeah, these bitches hard
Plenty 7.62s in this bitch, watch it hit his car
Bad bitch could be in a movie, she from overseas
'Wood full of 'za, hell nah, I ain't smokin' Breeze
Fifty of the trace, it got me high,
lookin' JapaneseI could never give a fuck about no nigga that was after me
