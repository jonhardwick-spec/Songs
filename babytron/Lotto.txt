It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga

[Verse 1: Talibando]
If I get the bag to you, can you move it?
I don't really think you can, you the type of nigga to lose it
Better start thinking with your head 'fore you lose it
Had to slow down on the lean 'cause sometimes I can abuse it
Bitch looking for love, that ain't me, I'm not Cupid
If you believed anything I said, then you stupid
It is what it is, bitch, don't come up with illusions
Kept it a hundred with you so it ain't no confusions
Everybody tote the strap, is you gon' use it?
Shit get real in these streets and it depend on how you movin'
You can take off like a rocket if you get the bag in Houston
Trappin' ain't dead, these niggas scared, that's what I'm proving
But I'll leave the streets alone if I can make it with this music
Until then, I'm quarterbackin' plays, Aaron Rodgers
I'm a cheesehead, been gettin' money since a toddler
Trap report card, got all A's, bitch, I'm a scholar
Dedicated to the game, they say I got it from my father
Open up your new lane, I would love to do the honors
Spot bangin' off the hinges, can't close, no, we McDonald's
So much money in the house, they had thought we hit the lotto
[Interlude: BabyTron]
Thought we hit the lotto
Ayy
Ayy
Ayy
