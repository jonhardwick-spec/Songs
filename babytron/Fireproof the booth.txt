[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Gotta fireproof the booth before I spit a verse (Whew)
With the hitman, you'd think he tote a shovel how he digging dirt
Four-figure soda, I just hit it with a six of purp (
You're not making this easy, Kyle
, brrt)
Big 42, I'm one up, you thinking it's a Dirk
Seven grams in the Slapwood got my vision blurred (Shit)
Find a lane with the scams or bust a brick and serve
.308 hit him in his spine, be done pinched a nerve (Boom)
Heart colder that a tundra
Caught a play in Allen Park, I'm on Rotunda
Brodie caught two opps dangling, start a GoFund 'em
Low IQ with the bag, you don't know nothing
Punching from the shadows, IP in the Philippines
I ain't spilling green, for the red, I'm still a fiеnd
If it's beef, add Swiss, turn that shit to Philly cheese
Wrong date on the AP, shit, silly mе
[Verse 2: JuSleaze]
Fat-ass knot in my pockets damn near ripped my jeans
I just hit a nigga green, he feel it in his spleen
Bitch don't know who she wanna fuck, she tryna do the team
Bitch, put your clothes back on, you finna use your knees
I'm finna use the cloned check when I hit the bank
Shark hoodie on, catch him ridin' fishbowl, then he gettin' ate
I heard your man finna turn into the Grinch 'cause his pendant fake
Finna hit my buyer, passin' out giffies like it's Christmas Day
Almost ran out the booth, Fordi talkin' 'bout he got a play
One thousand fifty-six blues guaranteed to make the counter break
(Off so many fuckin') Perc' 30s, I cannot concentrate
Cheap-ass nigga, you a petty spender, you ain't buyin' weight
Bust the windows on the Scat, hop in and switch the plates
Feds flick me in this bitch, I'm guaranteed to do the race
You said you run shit in the city? Well, I'm chasin' niggas down
Catchin' 'bows out of state, then ship 'em back in town
