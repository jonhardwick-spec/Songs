[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Put a bow on top her head, this bitch throat gifted
Green Marni fuzzy, lookin' like the Grinch that stole Christmas
Santa Claus, I got three hoes with me
Not a reindeer, it's pitbull, a red nose with me
Courtside dolo 'cause you wasn't tenth row with me
You can't up a ten, thumb a dub, or spend no fifty
Cuddy on the road scorchin', got some fent' 'bows with him
Tell a bitch, "Hell nah, I don't bless hoes, silly"
You ain't never, never, never self-check no giffies
Forty-five for this gig, but the next show sixty
Don't you see the check? Shit, I know my ex-hoes miss me
Make a ten in ten minutes, up the check so swiftly
Celebratin' with some Wocky, won't accept no whiskey
Awful lot of cough syrup, think it's Desto with me
Perc' man asked what color, told him Pepto Bis' me
(ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, long live $cams, you know?)
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Brodie lightin' up tree like it's Christmas time
If it's beef, up stick, make a shish kebab
All that tough tweetin' shit got his system fried
Hundred-round bop, boy, this bitch shoot from six to five
She ain't eatin' dick, tell a ho get off me
Bitch was on the nice list until I made his ho get naughty
When it's time to step, boy, you know we walkin'
Thinkin' I was sweet, did him sour, I just know he salty
Throw him on the bench, that boy ain't scorin' shit
Shit, what's hangin' off my neck? A couple ornaments
On my giffy run, I went in every store and tripped
Funny, it was up until we put him on the floor and dipped
All that jokin' got him smoked, where the Runtz at?
I can't find one to give, where the fucks at?
Need some drawers, ARP got a nutsack
She let me poke 'cause I touch paper, I'm a thumbtack
