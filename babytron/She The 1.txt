[Intro: YN Jay]
(
Enrgy made this one
)
Okay, like, I ain't even gon' lie, man, like, I think you the one, baby girl
Like, but I don't know though, you know?
Like, uh, like, I gotta ask myself that before I
You know what I mean? Before we
And then, she the one for sure
She the one for sure
She the one for sure, she the one for sure
She the one, huhhhhh
Ayy, she the one for surе
Favorite place to bump and grind while wе fuckin' slow
I just got caught up cheatin' with another ho
Like, why you always just like catchin' me, though? Like
You actin' like you ain't did nothin'
Bitch, you know I, ah!
[Verse 1: YN Jay]
Bitch, I know I cheated, why you act like you ain't did nothin'?
I ain't makin' babies but I'm still comin'
I'll make my nephews beat your ass, left the kids jumpin'
Bitch asked me, "Who the fuck is Faz?" That's my real cousin
Shout-out Big Mike, that's my lil' cousin
Got a small bitch, that's my lil' woman
That ain't dog shit, that's some lil' money
Left the trap house but it's still jumpin'
Got a lil' money but it's still somethin'
Got a natural bitch, she a real woman
Left my lil' cousin at the crib because he still somethin'
I just hope he don't steal nothin'
I don't drink liquor but I'm still buzzed
I ain't goin' out but I'm still clubbin'
I'm not my daddy friend but I'm still clutchin'
Kick a bitch out, I be still punchin'
I be in the woods where it's real huntin'
Make a bitch blow like a real trumpet
I ain't McDonald's but it's
Ah, she still love it
I ain't McDonald's but she still love it
Kick a bitch out, she was still clubbin'
I can hear the birds, it was real hummin'
You heard that, bruh?
