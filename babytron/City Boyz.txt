I'm the GOAT, I'll put it on ten Bibles
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Put yo bitch in a spin cycle
I'm the GOAT, I'll put it on ten Bibles
Ain't no punches through this bitch, doing ten titles
Walked in the store with one slide and got ten items
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Scam Wiz, I don't think I need college
Stan balling, throw a triple-team on him
Flex like the Hulk, I ain't never read comics
Fucked up the web off the punches, feel like Green Goblin
[Verse 3: JamesTooCold]
Ayy, bitch hit my phone for the BNB
Broke a whole four Mastercard, call me "Master P"
Work week, hit it for the ten, not thе fucking three
Fuck school, dark web taught me how to write and rеad, nigga
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Taught my rat how to punch, she ain't Master Splinter
She ain't have her eyebrows done so I had to spin her
Paid two hunnid on what I had for dinner
Double G's on the slide so you know I tagged the slippers
