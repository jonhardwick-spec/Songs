[Verse 1: Certified Trapper]
Switchy chopped and I hurt my fuckin' wrist (Fuck)
Don't leave me around your ho, I'ma fuck your bitch (Ah)
All this fuckin' ice, think I'm servin' out a hundred bricks (Bling)
I'ma slime his ass out with the forty, ha (Baow)
Bitch grab me by my chain and my shirt, yeah, I like that (Fuck)
Walked in, leather fuckin' jacket, call me
Mike Trap
(Jack)
Put a fuckboy in a blender, now he cake mix (Cake mix)
Walked in, fifty on me, niggas ain't say shit (Pussy)
Goin' straight to the ATM when your pape' hit
I'm goin' straight to the ATM 'cause my pape' thick (Ballin')
Drop fifty racks up at Johnny, I ain't say shit
Puttin' shit down six feet how we play, bitch (Fuck)
When you get that shit by the ton, you gotta move smart (Gotta move smart)
Chop got the long-ass nose 'cause it shoot far (Far)
Told lil' baby stay up in her lane, bеtter do part (Do part)
Bitch in my DM, take this shit too far (Man)
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Should I rock the cocainеs or play the charcoals?
Track 'em down to the G-way, blow up the Arko
I can coach you how to touch down just like the Harbaughs
Who the hell am I? Stop playin', I ain't Carlo
What I'm rollin' up, it's louder than a car crash
Second year, the most valuable, I'm like Lamar Jack
Don't you see it's black? You will never see this card maxed
Ridin' in the strikey-ikey, it ain't come with CARFAX
I ain't bein' quiet, doggy actin' like the FBI
Still ain't go and get a place, you actin' like the rent be high
Junkies gettin' fetty high
Pills with the quilt stitched in, I came from Fendi eyes
Yeah, I see you shakin' it, lil' ho, but pick the pace up
Buff-faced, I could pick a plate up
Ayy, I'm pickin' plays up
Pickin' pape' up, pickin' drank up
