[Intro: BabyTron]
Time to turn my yeah on
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'm off three different drugs, I got three different guns
How much 'za I be smokin', I need three different lungs
Raised a monster since a fetus, I just feed it for fun
Rollin' out the bodybag, I got some green on my thumbs
This is not
Street Fighter
, up the beam if he lunge
Scampire, late at night, I gotta drink me some blood
R.I.P. $cam, just for you, I gotta keep me a jugg
If we catch you in that forest, time to eat with the wolves
How I tote this bitch, you'd think I have a CPL
On the road more than the motherfuckers who got CDLs
How he talkin', how he movin', time to go, I think he 12
How this bitch actin' a hundred when she got a BBL?
Perseverance and stamina in the race, bet we prevail
Before you ride the wave, let everybody know you settin' sail
What the fuck is a vest? These bitches goin' through cylinder blocks
Tied in with the jankers, in the middle of the winter, I'm hot
I could probably fuck around and dunk if I sit on the guap
I can't spill no sauce nowadays, won't catch me drippin' a drop
Catch him with this fully out in traffic and hit him with Glock
Hit him up top
Free my unky, shit ain't been the same, they ain't gettin' they rocks
Name another motherfucker ran up a ticket in Crocs
Granny told my cuddy keep it down in there, hittin' the pot
Twenty seconds left, I shoot it like Lillard, I'm hot
Let her disrespect me in my face, be done spit on a thot
She'll spend up all your money, still'll go spit on her twat
I don't care how dizzy that I get, bet I spin with the chop
If I send the robbers to your safe, bet they pickin' the lock
Cheat-codin', think I got unlimited chicken unlocked
Gotta do the purple or the red, I can't ribbit the pop
Got the ball on the string, could just sit and dribble up top
Crazy how the tables turned, I couldn't even piss in the pot
