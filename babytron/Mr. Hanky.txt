(You're not making this easy, Kyle)
[Chorus]
Heard they tryna take me as the nice guy, nice try
Double-A twelve, pull up, turned his block to Five Guys
I got hippie lungs, Gallery Department tie-dye
Real life spaceships, we ain't livin' sci-fi
I can tell she wanna fuck, doin' all that side-eyein'
[Verse]
You try and take a half a dollar from me, you gon' die tryin'
Off an Oxy' hitting stains, bitch, I feel like Billy Mays
Million dollar game, yeah, I'm the king, I'm in my Gillie phase
I'm the shit like Mr. Hanky
Shoot the .38 with both hands,
the trigger janky
Hangin' out the window if it's issues, I ain't going on a rant
Two grams short of half in the slabs, Za Morant
Scratchin' opps off the list, that shit like stompin' ants
Should've knew the brick was fake, shit ain't even got a stamp
Mountain Dew on lava lamp, if he hidin', got a camp
Number one contender, put me in the ring, I'll drop the champ
Lil' brodie manned up and volunteered to hit the ten
One ho gettin' borin', told that bitch, "Bring a friend"
Serenede jeans stack, these are not no RTAs
Fuck a ARP, I pull up, clear the scene with RPK
This life shit up and down, kinda like a seesaw
Aston Martin with the horses, pull off in a yee-haw
Throw yo' album in the dumpster, that shit sounded weak sauce
Every card of the deck, I can't take no weeks offEvery day of the calendar
I'm pickin' up what you put down like I got scavenger
I ain't got no shame in my game, Frank Gallagher
Why they count me out? I shocked the world, Supreme Chancellor
Hunnid in the clip, twenty-five each 'cause he riding around with three passengers
Shit, R.I.P. them
Put a band on his head like he Big Ben
Could've put a hunnid on him, shooter owe me, though
Him Duncan, face card hot, San Antonio
Jerome Bettis
,
what you go and get that Rollie for?
Doggy barely stepping, what the fuck you got, some polio?
Toronto shows sold out, we look like OVO
Loubies, they don't rodeo, cut it with the bullshit
I ain't even have to aim with this full clip
Drop a fifty in this shit like the new Lucki
Cut the traction, this bitch spinnin' like a dune buggy
High as hell, my juice muddy
2017, the scam page was catching imbeciles
All that hate you doin', try to meet me at the pinnacle
The baddest kid in school, now I got more pape' than my principal
(ShittyBoyz, Dog $hit Militia, you know what the fuck goin' on)
