Off an X
,
fightin' my demons like I'm Ken Carson
He don't make a difference for his team, be on the bench startin'
Call of Duty is the only place you got rank
Need to go equip a belt, your bro and 'em just got spanked
This shit hittin' crazy, you would think the
'za tranq'
Middlemannin' checks, he on the 'Gram like, "Who got banks?"
The gang stuck together, we ain't Pangaea
Bitch ain't got a dollar 'less she go and use her man's Visa
Right before interrogation, tell 'em I got amnesia
How I run it up, you'd think I'm half man and half cheetah
I might ra—, never mind, that might get mе cancelled
He ain't got no standards, hittin' еverythin' like Mickey Mantle
Swipe, scam, jugg, back in school, it was the giffy scandals
Forty-nine and O, I'm on my way to winnin' fifty battlesTss, I'm finna tie Floyd
All that tryna cuddle, bitch, I'm tryna touch your thyroid
Day in Santa Monica, we vibin' at the Viceroy
Kicks say Rick, but I ain't snitching like the white boy
I don't trust dog,
he got a big mouth like Billy Bass
Blowed in the deep end, I'm floating like a lily pad
Run it up alone before I ever get a piggyback
Grade-A fibber
, can you rap 'bout what you really have?
If I'm masked up, it's doomsday, MF DOOM
Gold presi', red face, you'd think I went to FSU
We can see who ball harder, meet at Bal Harbour
All them fullies and he still died, he should've bought armor
Speak it to existence, shit, I'm finna work with Shawn Carter
