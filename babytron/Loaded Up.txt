[Intro: BabyTron]
RJRJ always tripping, manRJ always tripping, man
Aye, aye, aye, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Off the Runtz, grabbing Ksubis, I'm at Saks cooked
Fraud God, I made eighty off this MacBook
Oh, the slides ain't hitting? How the jacks look?
Doing fraud, see more numbers than a math book
Lil' blasian bitch pussy just like Fiji Water
Stiff-arming hoes, touchdown like Tiki Barber
Why you talking 'bout them Scats? You ain't seen a Charger
BIN fire, boy, this slide gon' ping regardless
Blessed with the gift, I got the X Factor
Made yo bitch rub my feet, we had sex after
Bro doing wrist work till the [?] shatter
Just made twenty off of Chase, I'm a check master
[Verse 2: Skilla Baby]
Got kicked out of high school, ain't have a prom date
Bro was Tiki, I was picking shit like Ronde
I got a girl to my junkie like a blind date
I'm five 'Woods in, I'm high as the crime rate
Bitches love when I'm on stage, chains dancing
Teeth fucked up, don't matter 'cause I'm handsome
I done hit [?] shit from [?] out of [?]
Life got better, bitch got badder
