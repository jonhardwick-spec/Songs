Ayy
[Verse]
Pale jeans, but the pop look like Thon Maker
Go and check the leaderboards, I'm the top player
Sosa with the short dreads, I'm a thot breaker
Quagen got me catchin' Zs, catch me out in Lalaland
Cherry poppers, boba tea, I'm with the zaza man
Lil' cuddy eatin' off the apples like Carlito
Tour stop in Nashville, done fucked around and saw Starlito
Tryna be a rapper, you can't even buy a beat
Tryna be a rapper, you can't even buy the leasе
Why the fuck you buy the shirt if you can't buy the snеaks?
Catch a flight OT, I'm tryna get high in peace
I got murder on my mind, burner on my side
I don't usually blow cookie, but the Berner's get me high
Y'all a burger and some fries, you and your mans
If it's ever rap beef, it's fuck you and your fans
Ain't no tryna double back, it's fuck you and your chance
The second it goes up, it's fuck you and your familyFuck you and your auntie, fuck you and your grannyFuck you and your daddy
Lookin' at the wall at the crib, all I'm missin' is a Grammy
Loadout got completed, I was missin' just a Banshee
They can't get me out the booth
The way I'm standin' on the business, they can't get me out the suit
Finna surprise the world again, they know what
Jimmy
'bout to do
They be duckin' when they see us, 'cause we really 'bout to shoot
Where you end up in life, shit, that's really up to you
Got a hundred things to say, but ain't got fifty bucks with you? Huh
Chains full of ice cubes, you ever seen a dead body?
Tryna be a funny guy, why you tryna Redd Foxx me?
We gon' fuck around and headshot him
Fuck hoes, drift whips, shoot blicks
Smoke dope, sip drank, shoot trips
Stack pros, make more, move bricks
And I still scam on the side, I got ten hobbies
Every day of the week, I got a bag
Every month of the year, I gotta stack
Boy, do you got a strap? You ain't gotta act
You ain't gotta cap, you ain't got a hat, boy
Where the fuck you at, boy?
Me, Glock, and fap-fap, we ridin' past Joy, we just left Press
Hit her with the dick, she needs a week bedrest
I learned two Perc' 10s equals less stress
The more time lollygaggin' equals less motion
It ain't never been the block, they on the 'net posted
I might get this ho a pendant out of Hutch, her neck golden
Ooh, I mean cold, shit, her neck frozen
Don't get bamboozled
When I'm feelin' bougie, shit, I eat lamb noodles
We pits, you a damn Poodle
I can sense when the love genuine
Said you tryna make a dub, hit the store, I'll send you in
Miyamoto Usagi, my jack jumpin' like a rabbit, catchin' plays is a hobby
You ain't ready for the wave, was raised to play in tsunamis
That shit fucked me up when you left, don't be sayin' you got me
