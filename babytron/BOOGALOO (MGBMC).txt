[Intro]
May God be my witness, may God bring me chicken
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
Long live $cam, you know? Nyah
Ha, ha, nyah, ha, ha, ha
Okay, okay, shit
[Verse]
I'll let the whole biscuit off and leave the fully hot
You gotta leave with that rego Glock, this the fully spot (Brrt)
Hit him with that fully yop, make him fully bop
DSM, fuck the kennel, why they got my bullies locked?
Yeah, I seen that lil' Skydweller, that's a rookie watch
He ain't hit a thing when he slid, he got a rookie shot
Boy, you's a pussy pop, your bitch gettin' her pussy popped
Boy, I'm too schooled, they was on the playin' hookie side
Flyin' 'round, too deep, just me and fine shit (Skrrt)
If she don't see that I'm a blessing, then she blind shit
They gon' see it as a weakness if you use some kindness
Walk up, crack a smile, show 'em what this .9 is (Pow)
I've been eatin' so good, I caught the -itis
Buttoned down in SoHo, if they catch me, off to Rikers
If I'm in the booth for too long, boy, I be done caught on fire
Irritatin' bitch, every day, I'm gettin' called a liar (Man)
I think the chicken crossed the street because he seen his twin
Bitch got a waterpark, might accidentally leave it in (Splash)
Huh, she a ten, can you blame me, though?
What I'm rolling's louder than a cranked-up radio (Cranked-up radio)
She gon' pick me up, give fellatio, then take me home
Told big cuz, "I'm rich now, I ain't your baby bro" (Nope)
Oh, this what they hate me for? (Wow)
In my evaluation, ain't it safe to say he's broke? (Lame)
In Miami on a yacht, the whoopties doin' 2C (Whoop)
Incognito on the skit, I might just scoop the hoopty
Let her hold my phone while she eat it, told her shoot a movie (Shoot a movie)
YO and Curtis, shit, I'm finna boogaloo it (Ayy)
Bedtime, tomorrow, doggy gotta two-to-two it (Snore)
We ain't worried 'bout your shottas, we'll shoot to shoot it
We'll kill the killers, we'll rob the robbers
All that moissanite, you honestly just better rockin' copper
So many eaters lined up, we can go bop for bopper (Damn)
Bitch forgot that I owned her until the collar shocked her (Shit)
Always got somethin' to say, but do you got a dollar?
All that role-playin', I'm surprised that she don't got an Oscar (Fuck)
I got a thousand sons out here, I'm a proud father (Wow)
Your eyes would've popped when I pulled this pound out her (Pound)
Tryna talk about the road, I'm the route founder
He don't really be up in the trenches, dog a downtowner
