[Intro]
Ayo, Mark A
[Verse: BabyTron]
Got some Wockiana, Quagy-agy, and some Tris 'round
You ever seen Stomp the Yard? You would get Chris Brown'd
Generation 5 on the stick, you would get blicked down
Cali' cartel, unky flying 'bows through the air
I heard you stressed, fucked up, smoking you a square
Can you put down them cancer sticks?
Said he just touched down? He a Colin Kaepernick
Pass the blick, seen an opp, I'm finna get active
So many horses in the hood, bitch, the whip prancing
Denver Nuggets, Nikola Jokić, bitch, my wrist dancing
Talking 'bout he a up a hu—, man, quit capping
Doggy acting like 12, call him Agent Murphy
Dog Shit Militia, ShittyBoyz, bitch, hang my jersey
Too cold to pump gas, seen a fiend and paid him thirty
Laimbeerin' in the Mike Amiri's off of playin' dirty
That's a forty ball
Y'all, my kids gon' be sick when y'all hear Maury call
This some witchcraft with my pop, now I'm snoring off
If you ain't learned a lesson from that L, you did more than lost
Can't relate, I'm feeling undefeated
2017, I was chilling, probably punching Neiman's
Oh, he such a demon? Tables turnt, sent him up to Jesus
I could leave the booth and make a hundred off a hundred pieces
Sixty Visas, forty Amex
Talking 'bout some stats? You ain't even played yet
Sliding down here dolo? Shit, you more than brave, neph'
Is you getting shot? That's like asking me if rain wet
I'm at the border with some pesos, dealing with connects
I'm hitting zaza, I can feel it in my chest
At the loft counting up, chilling with a check
C8 tinted, skrrt around, squealing in the 'Vette
If I up some pape', it was motivation purposes
Don't ask about this shirt, you can't purchase this
Whip loud as hell, neighbors looking through the curtains pissed
Would've thought unc' Medellín, how he serving bricks
Dawg don't wanna hit the blunt, I think he in the DEA
Seven Figure Man, goddamn, I knew I'd see the day
Team on my back, star player, I'ma lead the way
Hitman always stuck up, you know he keep a K
And of course I'm buffed up, don't you see the frames?
You better not touch none or brodie swinging Drac'
Took the stairs, not the elevator, fuck the easy way
Gang back to back in 700s, this a Yeezy day
Real road runner, y'all ain't never even took a trip
Huh, pape'd up, feeling like I'm Pablo
How the fuck is you a shooter? Heard that they took your blick
Boy, you better stop acting macho
