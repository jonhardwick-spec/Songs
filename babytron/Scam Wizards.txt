[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'm really different with this shit
You treat her like a queen, ain't shit different 'bout that bitch
Punches working magic, I'm a wizard with the drip
One shot'll end it all, feel like Lillard in this bitch
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Opps hate it when I bring up the Drac', Soulja Boy
Thought bro was Ice Cube, how he on the road with boy
This ain't daycare in the whip but we holding toys
Big pape on us, the check 'bout long as [?]
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Jamming at the self-scan, hand on the swivel
Don't believe what you say like yo ass Chicken Little
I blow money, I used to pick up every nickel
I'm shooting at the opps, I used to shoot it off the dribble
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Fuck Outback, Granite City for the steak
Fuck yoga class, get 'em stretched with the Drac'
Fuck the opps and every breathe that they take
Fuck Poshmark, StockX for the BAPE
Gucci footwork but I don't step with no snakes
Put that 'Wood down, you smoking less than a eighth
Check hit for ten, feeling blessed in the bank
Tryna make some rights for every left that I make
