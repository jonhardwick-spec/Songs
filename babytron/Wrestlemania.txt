[Intro]
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
You're not making this easy, Kyle
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Tired of sittin' here for nothin', told Danny, "Pull up the beat"
Finna slide and spark it, told my driver to pull up his seat
We'll pull up if it's beef, I promise, we ain't hidin'
Huh-huh, yeah, VPN is so encrypted, bitch, my loc' Timbuktu
If she see the roll, I bet yo' ho get fucked too
Big shell up in the chop', look like an armadillo
Oppers got some female tendencies, they only hard as pillows
[Verse 2: TrDee]
I ain't finna fight, this ain't WrestleMania (Uh-uh)
.762s hit him in his cranium (Grrah-rrah)
These niggas ass, we ain't never playin' 'еm (What's up?)
Ain't finna play no games, brodie brought the K with him (Baow-baow)
I do it for thе green, feel like Jayson Tatum (Okay)
I ain't got no time for you niggas, I be gettin' paper (No cap)
I can't even tell you what I'm smokin' 'cause it's different flavors
Might just pour up purple for Kobe, I feel like a Laker
[Verse 3: StanWill]
All my bitches bad as hell, but all my pieces good
Rap check lookin' like yo' salary, boy, I don't need to juug
Got a broomstick hangin' out the chop', I'm finna sweep the hood
Thinkin' 'bout them grannies that I scammed, I still be sleepin' good
Multi-colored diamonds in my ice, don't fuck with segregation
Bro ain't got no handles, when he pull up, it's no hesitation
Me and bro'll pull up shootin', we gon' Steph and Klay
Been ran through that finish line, the bag my only destination
