I done built this shit from nothing like it's Minecraft
Red bottoms on, I'm lava steppin' like a mineshaft
So many backstabbers, I might play the right shield
2tone AP when it hit the lights you think the diamonds teal
Why you drinkin' taylor port? You a major dork
Tryna keep up with the gang like eating steak with paper forks
Said he on my head, I'm real concerned
Pop out, drop his ass, grab the tag, that's a kill confirmed
Hit 'em where it hurts we aimin' for his jugular
Actin' like you servin' bricks, yo pockets they on customer
