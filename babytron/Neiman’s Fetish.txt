[Verse 1: Since99]
Indian plug and he stay up in Bucharest
Take a trip overseas, posted in Budapest
99 overall, bitch, I was born to flex
Blocking her number, I can't even send a text
20 on me, bitch, I feel like I'm Kay Felder
Got a piece of turtle pie, who the top seller?
Opps got me blind, looking like Helen Keller
Single mother, boutta go 'head and jug Heather
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
In the bay in a drop top
Feel like Lil Weezy, fireman left the block hot
Firеwork Faygo, with a 4 this a wok pop
AR 15 to his legs, make him hopscotch
Since99, BabyTron, this a chеat code
I get flashes of Lavine at the free throw
Reach for this chain, fuck around and get beat on
Unkie hit me with a brick, do he think I'm Deebo?
[Verse 3: Since99]
762 to his dome, it's a top shot
'Bout to go drop a half pound in the crock pot
Locked down when I'm on the court, force shot clocks
Surf for the turf, four course [?] the block [?]
Hibachi order got it straight off of DoorDash
Said he got a Scotty, flexing a buss pass
Foreign engineering swerving, got whiplash
Always feeling better, bitch, when I count cash
