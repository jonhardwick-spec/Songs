[Intro]
(

made this one

[Chorus]
I just got the case dismissed (I just got the case dismissed)
I just got the case dismissed (I just got the case dismissed)
I just got the case dismissed (I just got the case dismissed)
[Verse]
No probation for the kid, I'm finna face a zipRidin' 'round with the shrooms again, I'm finna take a tripRidin' 'round with the juice again, I'm finna take a sip
You can't judge a book just by the cover 'till the pages flip
This bitch hitting everythin', it ain't no point to aim a switch
I need money, power, and respect like I'm Jadakiss
Whole line full of Bruce Smiths, you can't shake the blitz
You ain't heard that chances make champs? Go and take a risk
I can play the game or coach it, I'm like Jason Kidd
This the Murder Mitten, bitch, it's cold, I'ma play the Timbs
Shout out to the last dude that tried me, this a eighth of him
Used to be the ramen flavor, now it's really steak and shrimp
Chopper leave that boy bald headed, Make A Wish
Shit, if he raise a fist, he ain't gon' get to raise his kids
How he popped up with that lead, you'd think it's time to take a quiz
Off an eight of Tris, every thirty gotta take a piss
Oh, you ain't got no hoes? Like, come and learn the game of rizz
Made her face switch twice, she grabbed my cup to chase the jizz
Probably think I'm eatin' onion rings but it's a plate of squid
Finna slam dunk on yo' bitch or rearrange her rim
