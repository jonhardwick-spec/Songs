[Intro: BabyTron]
Helluva made this beat, baby
Whew
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
On an opp hunt, ridin' 'round with them hell raisers
Twenty shotguns, I'm slidin' 'round with twelve gauges
Za' connoisseur, bust it open and I smell flavor
He spend it when he get it, I can tell he never felt paper
[Verse 2: GTP Daidoe]
My young niggas out they top, they be out here wild
I be thinkin' bout the opps, like when is they gon' slide?
Give that boy a face shot, that nigga almost died
Pour a six, pop a Perc'-10, that make me comе alive
You let your bitch set thе play, then she dyin' with you
Two-three set this money on the floor, I'm like I'm slidin' with you
Only ARP's in this whip, it ain't no .9 pistols
He actin' hard 'cause he got that gun, he like Brian Nichols
[Verse 3: $camaurion 72]
Might hit LA broke as fuck, leave with nine giffy's
My nigga Tron iced up, look like—
Bitch I'm only pourin' Wock' or Tris, you be dyin' sippin'
Niggas really broke as fuck, why I don't mind niggas
Bang on all on a nigga block, they think LeBron did it
Your bitch tryna take my Ksubi's off 'cause Travis Scott did it
Me, I'm pourin' up purple syrup, you be pine sippin'
First it was Balmain, now it's Number (N)ine denim
