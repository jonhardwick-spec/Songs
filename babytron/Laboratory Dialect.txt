[Verse 1: BabyTron]
It only take an hour and some change to make a dollar and some chains
When I'm off the drugs, the problems, they don't bother me the same
I'ma still be a dog in a collar gettin' trained
All my scammers on the road, I'm with the robbers for the day
I might take a flight tomorrow just to make my bitch miss me
Could be the last two on Earth, wouldn't let your bitch kiss me
They just wired six-sixty, I was down to six giffies
Lookin' in the mirror like, "You know you got 'em sick, Jimmy"
You ain't window-shop with me, you ain't drip with me
You ain't never split a pop with me, you can't sip with me
You can't pour a six with me, roll it out the zip with me
If he ridin' in my whip, he blowin' off the hip with me
Why you want the nowadays sauce? Ain't jam a chip with me
When it came to goals, you ain't never scratch the list with me
Wasn't on that mongoose, then you can't stab the whip with me
You ain't put none on the first bag, can't cash a brick with me
Lil' crazy bitch'd come and catch a hat with me
I know if Mauri was here, he'd come and catch a jack with me
Is you really down to ride? Ain't never caught a flat with me
Like, is you gon' call a ride and leave, or call the cab with me?
If he a Militia member, let him dog the 'Cat with me
Antisocial club, and nah, you can't toss no racks with me
You ain't finna get a deal, like, why you talkin' fast with me?
Ever think I'm fallin' off, I'm just fallin' back, really
