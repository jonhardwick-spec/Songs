[Intro]
Ayy (
My nigga Lee, I think we got another one
)
Ayy, ayy
Broke the zipper on my bag when I hopped inThat means I ain't never leaving, bitch, I'm locked in
Fuck a chain, 2020, I'ma drop ten
I'm the GOAT, when I hang it up, I'll be top ten
Really fucked up the game when I popped in
Feel like Lee with the beat, brought the chop in
SportsCenter, catching plays like the top ten
I'm the GOAT, when I hang it up

[Verse 1]
Mama said I'm hard-headed, she can't tell me nothing
Super sense for them M's, I can smell 'em coming
Avoid every snake I see, boy, I'm venom-ducking
One thing my granny said is if they seem jealous, fuck 'em
I remember when they used to look down on me
Say what's up, now they can't get a sound out me
Lil' bitch, she can't handle what I got on me
D coordinate, hit a left, spilled the pop on me (Skrrt, skrrt)
They need to hang my jersey up in the fucking rafters
All NBA first team, pro-scammer
Cussed the waiter out at Ruth Chris, ain't no manners
When I hang it up, come get on, I'll coach after
They closed the mall at two o'clock 'cause I tore it up
Pregame, these the lay-up lines, I'm just warming up
It was rainy, now I'm shining, bitch, the storm is up
Jumped in the deep, Mr. Krabs got the formula
