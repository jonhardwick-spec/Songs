[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Ooh, Sav killed it
)
Ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Sav killed this bitch
Someone grab some cereal, your mans milkin' it
Dior swim trunks, they dippin' in ol' Vilebrequin
Why the fuck you worry 'bout my plans, man? I'm buildin' 'em
Yeah, I see you flexin' two straps, you can get killed with 'em
Lone wolfin', movin' through the wilderness
Talkin' 'bout some white gold, that chain's lookin' silver-ish
Caught him checkin' out and checked him out at the Hilton Inn
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
Mmm, shit, where do I begin?
It's 2024, want pape' and way lesser friends
I'm Who Decide War down to the floor before they catch the trеnd
I play a couple hoes' boyfriend, but that's for prеtend
My face card say a whole star, but I ain't Mermaid Man
Beat the white with my gloves on like these OJ hands
Nigga asked for somethin' and never even met you, I don't know you, man
I hope you finally win one day, like a Pistons fan
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
This ain't no fanny pack, bitch, it's an ice box
We'll get him left just off the right— ah
Just off the right shot
You ain't never left a stain like some white socks
Pullin' strings like a ventriloquist
Sent Ray out the Curry, it's still ten in this bitch
Equivalent to a fetty brick, bitch, I'm dope
She like, "You don't want the head for real?" Like, yeah, bitch, I'm sure
You gotta say that shit twice, I'm off a deuce, bitch, I'm slow
Like you gotta say it twice, I'm off a shroom, bitch, I'm throwed
Man, if you do, you do, if you don't, ain't shit to know
I get juice by the pint, like really, it ain't shit to pour, you know
