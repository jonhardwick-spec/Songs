[Intro]
Long live the PA prince

Huh, yeah
[Verse]
You can blame the Kia Boyz, my youngins tryna steal Hyundai
I can meet the plug on Sunday, I can get the deal by Monday
If you get too curious, gon' up banana clip like George
Thinkin' 'bout lil' $cam, don't ask what's in my Fanta, it's a four
Thinkin' 'bout lil' Chris, it fuck me up you ain't see eighteen
Told my coaches I ain't playing if it ain't the A team
I got so many fucking people depending on me
You can try your hardest, how it feel to be a step below me?
Bitch popped a ten, hopped on top and went aggressive on me
Tryna estimate my living cost, go 'head and guess a number
Stacking for three seasons then go loco, how I spend the summer
Fuck a money counter, double-T, I'm a tremendous thumber
D$M, I damn near wrecked the Hummer
Only 'cause I put that bitch in neutral, hit the sunroof and tried to test my jumper
Pressure bust pipes, I think it's time them boys send a plumber
They can't handle it
He tried to be a superhero, now his candles lit
Call the corner up, you can't do nothing with them bandages
Right before we knocked the soul up out him, he was panicking
You can't pay off them damages
Everything I did, I manifested
It's fun and games 'till you become a grown man, it's hectic
Doggy pulled up with some hit drank and got him banned from sessions
Eighthy in the backpack, don't think the pants neglected
I got a dub in these Yamamotos
Tryna hit me with that neck, I'm like, "I gotta go, though"
Paranoid, I got that feeling, I might watch the dough, bro
All these bricks up in the kitchen, but it's not a dojo
Cuddy backs left
I ain't rocking VLONE but I'm high as hell, got bad habit
It's all laugh-laugh 'till we pull up on 'em, fap-fapping
This ain't Warzone, when it's some smoke, you can't just gas mask it
You ain't in my tax bracket, you ain't got a bag, wow
Ain't nothing in your stash, how?
Before Jerry seen the pistons, unky had a stackhouse
Got it cracking, turned the opp spot into a crab house
Stayed down until came up, I can brag now
We won't camp your crib forever, don't get dragged out
Only stopping from the back when we follow the Nazra
Ain't the Hellcat, but it's a kitty, brought the Jag out
Me, myself and I promise that we good
Take these bitches off for Buffalo, I promise these ain't 'Woods
Walking off the stage, they wanna encore
These some Mike Amiri runners, not no Tom Ford
Tron, Tron trying dial on the top four
You gon' need a key father, hit the top floor
You don't ever hold it like you own it, no, that's not yours
(We know that's not yours, we know that's not yours)
