[Verse 1: Prince Jefe]
I'm ridin' with the hitman, don't look too long
Sendin' raw to the knocks with two different hoes
If I go broke, I cut the blender on
It just take a head nod to get a nigga smoked
Menace to society, I'm living like I'm Caine
I don't know why niggas eyein' me, don't wanna meet the Drac'
I'm in the Track, they get behind me, I'ma do the race
Try to box me in, I hit the switch and send you to the Gates, pussy
I could blow a sixty, you can't do the same
Pocket full of Nipseys, sip red for the pain
Quarterbackin' in thе field, doin' two-a-days
Ooh, he broke, hе poured an ace, sellin' fish, got Coi Leray
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
Dropped a baby in the pot and birthed a replica
Ridin' with the— I got a trunk full of angelica
Travel for that check, my niggas scam across America
Printin' out the glass, he typed his name in Helvetica
I got flowers by the plethora, I sell dope and etcetera
We got more cake than Debora, this Swiss roll, it ain't edible
How you niggas still broke? That shit unethical
Sketchin' hoes' titties at the shows, it look unlegible
Lean on me, the pipe come with a kickstand
The same niggas claim they don't like me, they big fans
Unc' a war vet, they amputated his left hand
But he still cook the raw with his nubs and a frying pan
