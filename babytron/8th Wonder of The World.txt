[Intro]
(You're not making this easy, Kyle)
[Chorus]
BabyTron, I'm the eighth wonder of the world
Dogshit Militia, we'll take that Hummer on a twirl
[Verse 1]
Wouldn't change a thing about the journey, shit, it made me me
I only had one plan, not no ABC (I only had one plan)
I knew I'd be a rapper, I was circling anything on that ACT
Glocky on me, I'm the Ironman, I feel like AC Green
Wake up, Listerine, then I lean, it's a daily thing
Leavin' out with ninety AmEx, I bet eighty ping
I got four pockets full, you'd think these Lil Baby jeans
I'm a check droppin', card swipin', jack pingin' hacker
Sniper creepin' in a black hoody, hash slingin' slasher
Don't say that he thе plug if your mans bringin' bammer
He damn near a Hardy Boy, Stan keep a laddеr
We cannot compare, that's cubic zirconium
Destroy his whole clique, now he lonely like Opium
Sick doggy lost his stripes standin' on that podium
I'm a chemist with that test tube, buffs white as sodium
Three-hundred-dollar pair of socks, just call me Leonidas
Taught myself, it wasn't hard, ain't never need no guidance
Shit, David and Goliath, you could be the giant
Never read and wrote in English class, but I was Visa swiping
