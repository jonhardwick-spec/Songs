[Verse 1: TrDee]
In my own lane, only time I switch is in my whip
It can shoot for minutes, you ain't see it? Boy, look at the clip
I don't even steal, but I make all of my bitches strip
Real 'za, you might fall asleep, you take another hit
Pass me the ball, I'm like Dame when he in the clutch
I can't believe you really caught an Ice, you should've went to Hutch
Sorry, boo hoo, we done, yes, I'm leaving in a rush
Niggas are not on my head, the only thing is just my brush
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
7.62s'll knock the trunk off an elephant
Zion works, spot jump like the Pelicans
Up off the rap, I'm finna punch for the hell of it
You don't really scam, boy, you up off a settlement
Double cup at Beni's, eating steak, drinking medicine
Christion Loubs red and white, I'm fresher than a peppermint
Text the bitch, if she ain't throwing neck, delete our messages
Seven deep up in the long-sleeve with like seven sticks
[Verse 3: TrDee &
BabyTron
]
Me and money really go together like we both rhyme
Who gon' stop me? I only slow down at stop signs
You a point guard in that room, bet you drop dimesY'all can't fuck with 99 or S.B., so stop trying
