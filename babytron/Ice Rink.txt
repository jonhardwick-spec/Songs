[Intro: BabyTron]
Yo, I'll start this bitch
Fuck, ayy, ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Spin the 'Cat, turn the street to an ice rink
Opened up a 'bow of that Fart, now my eyes pink
Diamond boy, spent one-fifty on just five links
Vin Diesel when I'm on that road, Kidd Tyrese
[Verse 2: KrispyLife Kidd]
Just bust another 'Rex 'cause the stove on high heat
I bought my bitch red bottoms 'cause she is not cheap
I'm crankin' at a high level and that's high-key
Got a better chance beefin' with God than tryin' to fight me
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
3.00 Blackouts, try and fight these
Marni hit me for a band on a white tee
Wear it once, throw it out, fuck a dry clean
Boy, you a fan, you be rappin' on our type beats
[Verse 4: KrispyLife Kidd]
I had Tron punch this bitch, yеah, this flight cheap
Gen5 with the switch on hеr, this a nice heat
At the Garden, courtside with the Knicks like I'm Spike Lee
I just bought a deuce and dropped it in a Lipton, this a spiked tea
