[Verse 1: TrDee]
Chopstick kick him like it's kung fu
Only 'cause he wanted clout, now he on Fox too
Cold-ass world, gotta watch the ones around you
I knew that we would blow, we was bound to
She a bougie bitch, she keep on begging for a getaway
Thinking how I run it up but I'm still not in shape
Niggas see you winning and they start to feel some type of way
Only catch me with Ben Franklins, I ain't got a bae
He'll up that bitch and shoot it quick, Shawn Marion
Only care about the green, vegetarian
She gon' really fuck the gang for the experience
Gang'll blow you like a Black, are you serious?
All my opps jokes, they hilarious
Used to hate on us, now we victorious
Trackhawk, drive it like it's Fast & Furious
How are you a shooter? Back in school you was the scariest
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Moose Knuckle coat, I could've punched it but I spent a band
Then went and spent another thousand on the belt and pants
Skillet on the chop, he get away? I bet we melt his mans
I can show you how to make a fifty with no helping hand
I need some sealed Wockiki, where the Juice Man?
'Oop it to habibi, he gon' dunk that bitch with two hands
I can make a hunnid off a CD or the new scams
Hutch kit Fiji, next year gon' look like [?]
Have my hitman walk you down, turn you 'round and face you
ARP with the beam, boy, I ain't gotta chase you
Bitch, I'm in the Striker with da Vinci, boy, he bound to paint you
If you end up in the pen with unky, boy, he bound to shank you
At the scam house, feel like Jerry, this the stackhouse
Pulled a Lamb' out, cut the traction off and spaz out
Three-five of some, shit, fuck, I might pass out
Hunnid rounder knock him out the game like he lagged out
