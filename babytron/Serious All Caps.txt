)

Ayy
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz (
It's Lando, yo bitch know, don't let yo bitch go, nigga
)
[Chorus]
I don't play games, I play with the cards
I'ma play with her then play with her heart
Bitch scoring too, she can play with the sparks
Put a hammer to his head, turn him to a shark
I don't play games, bitch, I ain't Triple H
Punch, punch, punch, looking like a middleweight
How the fuck I'm out the way but still in the way?
Only dunking foreign hoes, I ain't hitting eights
[Verse]
Handpicked fit from Saks, I don't need a stylist
Stop saying that you up, you ain't seen a island
Couldn't pass English class, now I'm Visa writing
Stop talking APs, you ain't seen a [?]
Speaking of AP, I just touchdowned
Gucci Gang on my feet, feel like Pump now
I ain't walk off the porch, boy, I jumped down
Looking like comic book off the Runtz cloud
Chilly moe, spent seven on Beluga Yeezys
Captain Save-A-Ho, boy, that bitch was super easy
Would talk about the opps but they too benеath me
Bitch asked if I was TID, through the 'oop to Sweezee
Spеaking of bro, the clip full of baldheads
Wizard Kelly to these hoes, I need all head
Pull a whole balance off, I need all bread
Stop talking 'bout, they all dead
Blowing Cookie, I look like a Japanese Korean
Got half off the banks, other half from Visas
Superpower with this punch, you can ask Vegeta
Fraud star, think I'm finna buy a scam arena
All rookie swipe team, call me "Luka Trončić"
Bitch a hoochie, gave her forty and she blew my Johnson
A thousand bucks for these bitches, these shoes ain't common
Broke-ass boy, yo pops should've used a condom
Dropped a four and got some head, I'm finna hibernate
Bro hit the road, I had his back like a license plate
Thigh pad on me, it's a 49ers day
If they ain't have gun laws, I'll swipe a K
Huh, and damn near a rocket launcher too
Nah, for real, slide'll knock the chimney off his roof
She gave me head, I look down, thought I lost my shoes
Off-White belt on, better be cautious, dude
"What is ShittyBoyz?", bitch, it's three scammers
Thousand dollar phone on me came with three cameras
I think we could stop Thor with these three hammers
Walked in the store and I got rich off of three jammers
This white bitch gave me head for a Frappuccino
Yeah, I heard yo song but I know it's capperino
Talk crunchy like I just ate a bag of Cheetos
Touchdown MIA, feel like Dan Marino
Valentinos on, got me feeling European
It's all bad if TrDee turn into a demon
Running errands in Dior, I'm turnt for no reason
Translate and Telegram, I plug German [?]
Louis sneakers on my pivot, boy, that's French dressing
If she ain't throwing neck, she can't get a text message
Just scuffed the Louis, now I'm Triple S stepping
Go and get a bag, buddy, that's the best lesson
It ain't a thing on my ass but the Ksubi tag
Scuffed the kicks and threw a fit, with my bougie-ass
Living Gucci out of town, in my Gucci bag
Drinking wine, getting head in a jacuzzi bath
