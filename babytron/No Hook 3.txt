[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Put some numbers on you squares like a calculator
Don't jump stupid, bro will put you on a ventilator
Black and gray Balencis, looking like a damn Oakland Raider
In Neiman's tripping, almost fell down the escalator
Bro been rolling all week off them damn pills
Made six in thirty like them damn basketball drills
Run up on me? Swear to God shit gon' get real
Looking like a construction crew with these big drills
I'm just balling in Ypsi like I'm George Gervin
Good four in this cream Faygo got a nigga swerving
Need the crud? Call bro Dre 'cause he out here serving
Served a fiend two eights likе that nigga Michael Irvin
I don't wrestle, bitch, do I look likе Randy Savage?
Explosive tips up in this clip, they hit you, they gon' do some damage
I don't play with niggas, I'll put a pussy in a casket
Fell in love with the swiping, used to shoot up in the basket
Oh, you [?] with the bank account then hit my line
Learned how to swipe on my own, I couldn't wait in line
Ham finna send some money, told her she can take her time
Thought it was a bird but, nah, I'm in the Robins flying
ShittyBoyz [?] boys, it's all the fucking same
And if you don't rock with BabyTron then you a fucking lame
Balmains on my ass, you wearing joggers, that's a fucking shame
Niggas hating players, better hate the fucking game
