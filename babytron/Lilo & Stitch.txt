[Intro: Batmaan Jay]
(
Reuel, stop playing with these niggas
)
Yea, Batmaan Jay bitch
BabyTron in this shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
[Chorus: Batmaan Jay]
I'm tryna get a feature with that nigga Rio
Movin' all these bricks, like Shaq's free throws
If you snitch, then you get a stitch like Lilo
Me and all my niggas, yeah, we pull up in Bugattis
You ain't got no Molly, you ain't got no body
I be smokin' all this weed, like Bob Marley
I just fucked a barbie, feel like Jeff Hardy
You an internet nigga, call you like Carly (Mmm)
And I ain't even got no time for a bitch
If you want it, then you gotta wait in line for it
Run a bitch over, like I'm fuckin' Eddie Lazy
Smokin' all this Zaza and it got me feelin' spacey (Uh)
I've been feelin' pretty lazy (Uh)
All these bitches wanna chasе me (Uh)
I've been rappin' on a daily (Uh)
(Yea, lil' bitch)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Wait
That ain't a montclair, that's a guеst cup
Born into mint and still buzzin' on a West Coast
223 hit his back side, I bet his chest broke
Try to ride the wave, you gonna end up in a wrecked boat
Lead town in a rental, come back with some Visa money
Had to skirmish since 16, been a Visa journey
The opps broker than a jokin' boy, I really think it's funny
Did you pour one? Like why the fuck yo pop ain't even muddy?
Heh, I am not hidin'
Heh, check the score, that bitch lopsided
For some chicken, shoot her up the drum, he a Popeye
On the rise, so I keep a strap like I'm rock climbin'
Heh, bitch don't open up that glove box
Heh, she was spinnin', she a lil' 9
Heh, ain't go lie, I feel like the one now
Couldn't find the cord, I'm the source in the plug now
Hundred dollar [?], turtle pie, this some platinum whap
I'm the type to get the bros open, you ain't passed the rock
Had a sleepover with yo bitch, ran through the Magnum box
Boy we got this shit on clamps, you can't unlatch the lock
