[Intro: BabyTron]
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
DSM, we in some AMGs, we movin' like the mob
Figure out his nine to five and move him out his job
Lookin' like I'm buildin' houses, toolie on my side
Fucked around and turned my pop into a smoothie, sippin' pod
Two hundred 'bows, a hundred pints
Spot lookin' like Walgreens, I'ma grind a hundred nights
Walkin' out the store, a pack of Russian Creams and a pack of ice
TSA, my heart beatin', fucked around and punched the flight
Am I strapped? (Yeah)
And I'm racked up
Caught him ridin' TRX, shit, now he in the crashed truck
Eightie in my 'Wood, I won't pass it, I'll sell you one
Million dollar game, you better listen if I tеll you somethin'
Flight so unpredictable, you can't prеdict the jealous ones
Pull up shootin' with that heat, I feel like Kendrick Nunn
Yeah, it's like that
High as hell, my Sprite black
Douple cuppin', hell nah, this not no ice cap
[Chorus: TurkeyMan]
Sellin' bricks out a McLaren, movin' through the hood
A hundred thousand worth of ice on me while I'm bustin' juggs
Sellin' bricks out a McLaren, movin' through the hood
A hundred thousand worth of ice on me while I'm bustin' juggs
