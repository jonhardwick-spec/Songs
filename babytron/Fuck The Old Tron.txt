[Intro]
Fuck the population
, ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, long live $cam, you know?
[Verse]
Yeah, I used to fuck around with your mama, you my godson
Fully switchy, better pray that God come
Or at least that the cops come
How the fuck you lookin' for the opps? You got a prop gun
White sticks, black sticks, yin, yang
Hit him with that fully switch like bing-bang
Had to put the work in 'fore the rings came
I'm either high or the weed taste like cheesecake
Rockstar, I've been high a hundred weeks straight
You ain't tryna get to it, I can't relate
She want a dub for her neck, that's some cheap brain
ShittyBoyz caught him out, he got some pee stains
Did the st-st-stomp, I got some creased Bapes
Bougie bitch hit the crib tryna freeze grapes
Bougie bitch wake up tryna eat crepes
Hit tens, tote 9s, and we drink eights
The type of head that I'm gettin', I might be late
Is the weed laced? I can't think straight
You can't get me on a track 'less that fee paid
I'm in love with the drank, think it's V-Day
Lando pulled up in that Yukon, not an E-lade
It was 2022 if I had on three chains
2016, your bitch made it to my keepsake
Threw the white buffs on my face, I can't see hate
Everything seems great, don't it?
Karo'd doggy bone, he in a fake coma
Moved into a new crib, I might just grab a Bape sofa
It was cream, but I turned it to a grape soda
In the hood, iced out, you'd think I scrape yola
I'm an A-hole, Yae Yae on PA, Jordans off the Draco
Finna get my nod on, Morton's off the Faygo
Hoes do it pronto whatever I say so
Ride around, big TRX, body in the back
I can't show my every move, they copyin' the cat
Mind stuck on the grind, need some Wocky for a nap
Militia conversations be like, "Copy, roger that"
Pause, but I don't like how the 'Wood taste
I forgot how to push brakes
Overdid the shrooms and the juice, I can't look straight
I'll get the whole hood spanked on a good day
.308s turn his beanie to a pair of earmuffs
He rollin' bullshit, it gotta be some hard-to-hear Runtz
I'm finna fuck my favorite opp's bitch
I'm finna fuck my favorite opp's bitch to start the year up
Looked at my bank account, I might tear up
It ain't changed since high school, you still a weird fuck
Little weird butt
He ain't never dropped a pair of buffs, he must fear Hutch
