I was on the bleachers, contem— Yeah (

SBDSM, SBDSM
[Verse 1: TrDee]
I was on the bleachers, contemplatin' if this shit for me
Got up out my feelings, I forgot that I was TrDee (I forgot)
Baby girl don't like me, but her brother wanna be like me (Swear to God)
Push the break to start it 'cause the whip I'm in don't need a key (Phew, phew, phew)
Got bread like a sandwich, come between it, you a ham (Lame)
These niggas be cappin', they ain't never did a scam (Cappin')
Look at what you post, that's why y'all ass ain't got a man (Freak ho)
I already know who I'ma call in that jam (Brrt)
I already know who really with mе and who ain't (I do)
Dick put her to sleep like we was in hеre sippin' drank (Ayy, ayy)
I ain't tryna fuck with you, just tell me who your bank (Who you bank with?)
They can't fuck with me, tell them I got a higher rank (You can't)
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Somewhere out in space, I'm rollin' fire, baked
I just did the foolie, let me go make sure my tire straight
Hundred Apple products, let's see what my buyer say
Built like Tony Stark, it's in me and on me, I'm Iron Man
Seven cities, six days
Must ain't know that I can make a seven-fifty six ways
The Benz ten minutes 'til six
I'ma throw 'em in the blender with finishing mix
White buffs off the Tech, I'm on Michigan shit
He don't really know the juice, shit, I'm hittin' his Tris
They got a fetty tolerance, shit, I'm hittin' the brick
Like a black belt
Fire bender with this fully switch, just watch his ass melt
