[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Underdog, watch me steal the show, walk in, I'ma steal your ho
Robber on the lootin' side of things, he tryna steal your gold
Better get to shootin' with that bitch or he gon' steal your pole
I'm talkin' take it off your waist and then steal your soul
You can't fake the fake forever, shit, the real gon' show
Wish that I could sip the slow-mo fast 'cause I heal by pour
I'ma end up cuttin' hands off, they try to steal my load
Don't get turned into an amputee
Said he in Militia like, come on, what type of stamp you see?
What type of pants you rockin'?
Heard you got a pendant on the way, what typе of bands you droppin'?
Be broke or be rich, I had two options
Can't you see which onе I chose? Can't you see which one I picked?
Would've thought I hit the road, off the shroomies, this a trip
Talkin' 'bout some Neiman Marcus, he in Zumiez for his 'fit
Bitch talkin' 'bout she broke, you got a coochie, just go trick
'Cause I can't help you, I'm selfish
It's pussy in the room, shit, I smell it
Cock the Draco, fah-fah-fah, now it's a hot potato
Caught him rockin' Palm Angels, how ironic
Caught him rockin' Palm Angels, how ironic that he got a halo
Spent your last to get to Mexico, now you ain't got a peso
It's a wrap if they want beef, you know I got the queso
When the ball dropped, I sipped Wock', not añejo
TRXs vroom-vroom-vroomin', these are not Durangos
Damn near melted, this shit got so hot, I had to stop and lay low
I'm in Somerset, I only came to shop for play clothes
