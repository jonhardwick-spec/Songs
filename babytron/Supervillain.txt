[Intro]
"I've been dead once already. It’s very liberating. You should think of it as, uh, therapy""Jack, listen. Maybe we can cut a deal""Jack? Jack is dead, my friend. You can call me 'Joker'"
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Smoking jokes up, this the real Runtz
On the road with plastic,
unky in the trap with pill dust
Blew six figures thinking, "How the fuck I’m still up?"
Pull up to your cookout with a skillet, tryna grill some
Diabolical, I'm feeling evil off this Wock' soda
Got shit moving sitting down but I am not Yoda
Air Forces look like Christian Loubs, spill my pop on 'em
Backdoor season, better lock it, I don't knock on them
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Put some holes in him like he SpongeBob
Gang opp lurking,
if he smart, he won't go live
Tryna get some sauce? Your whole team full of Planktons, damn
I'll let you go, lick the only thing I'm chasing, ma’am
I’ma keep making niggas hate me like a supervillain
I don't pat myself on the back, guess I got used to winning
Don’t ask me 'bout no old hoes 'cause they super finished
Real ShittyBoy, we had thrust back with True Religions
[Verse 3: StanWill]
I ain't gon’ lie, this beat weak as fuck
Surfing Neiman Marcus with a punch, finna beat it up
Whip it out the Fendi boxers, she gon' eat it up
We got twenty bop sticks tucked but it's three of us
She thinking that her head with a Birkin bag? I'ma ho this bitch
Fuck a show-and-tell, if I up it, I'ma blow this bitch
I'm the biggest shitter out, you should know this shit
Face card scorching, riding 'round with the coldest bitch
