[Intro]
(
Meech
)
All the plays that I called, I need a highlight reel
Off the shrooms, shit, I think I'm in the Twilight Zone
Shit, fuck, damn, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
[Verse]
All the plays that I called, I need a highlight reel
Off the shrooms, shit, I think I'm in the Twilight Zone
She gon' be a cheerleader how I sideline hoes
How you acting tapped in? Ain't even got the Wi-Fi code
Sick y'all boys buying kits, I wouldn't even buy my ho
I done did it for too long, you think I'm finna bite my tongue?
Let me pour up my mud, let me light my blunt
Started off down, bet the rest of my life I'm up
I bet it's on the floor, we get that pinpoint
Unky in the kitchen, he just damn near popped a wrist joint
Said he need a number one, well, meet me at the Big Boy, huh (Ayy, ayy)
540 'round the opps' block, do the Mac McClung
Told my bitch she can have fun when that package come
Tried to throw it on, but you ain't even matching, bum
Make it rum-bum-bum-bum when I attach the drum
For the blues, bro crunching like a Nestl√© bar
What Drake say?
YOLO
, you can't press restart
Yeah, I had a cream soda, now that bitch Pepsi dark
Out in Philly cookin' up like that lefty guard
I'm an orca whale, you a tadpole
They be spine stabbers, tryna play it like your backbone
Deep in the trenches, in the bando like Lando
Don't even ask if I got it, that shit mando
Got a stash spot, I ain't put it underneath the chair
Why he playing? Tryna knock his head from underneath his hair
Giving cop vibes, dude fishy as a SPAM can
We can talk scams, I be dumpin' like the trash man
Magic man, I was born in the Enchanted Forest
I was lil' dog, now I walk around, bag enormous
Bitch, can you please shut your mouth? I'm in The Lab recording
Playin' 'round with three different drugs, I done crashed the foreign
Poured a cup, rolled a blunt, then I bit a shroom
Told my brothers, "This shit from the womb 'til we in the tomb"
Pushed the pedal like zoom, bet the whip'll vroom
Wicked bitch a witch, how she ride it, shit, the dick a broom
Shoot the work east, I'ma leave it with my New York seller
I just scored on some Wock', time to find a New York Seltzer
Seen 12, took 'em on a good race
Hopped out, boots tied, took 'em on a foot chase
I could catch a hundred splinters, shoot it 'til the wood break
What I say once? "It's a good play, good day"
You getting too close, boy, don't break the barrier
If her name ain't a trillion, I ain't gon' marry her
