Fuck the fire, we got grease

(It's a Helluva beat, baby)
[Verse]
If it's war, then I'm front line
Off the Quagen in the whip, I don't drunk drive
Every day, it's a grind, not sometimes
Some days rainstorm, some sunshine
Fifty racks, rubber band it, I ain't got enough, tie it
Touch down in the O like a Buckeye
If I up this roll, guarantee she'd be buck-eyed
Thirty pointer, forty pointer, watch the buff shine
Yeah, I'm on top now, but it was a rough ride
Been the one, you can ask Miss Krumrie
Up high, I just left my double cup dry
Bitch a nickel, but she actin' like she plus five
When bro slid through, whoever ain't duck died
Long trip, you would think we on a truck ride
Fan hot as hell, tryna get his gun signed
Life a gamble and I'm on the good luck side
Slam dunkin' work like the gut smacker
Stay away from bro, he a buff snatcher
Ridin' in the spaceship, it's only right I tuck blaster
Throw the work on the floor, it get stumped after
On the wild West, gotta know I'm gun slingin'
Sun beamin', fuck around, I might come demon
Sick you put your lips on her, she just drunk semen
Dude actin' like a cop, it ain't cuff season
Once you post some weird shit, get that one treatment
Fat-ass pocket watchin', better watch your calories
Fat-ass pocket watchin', better watch your salary
Jeans Chrome Heart, shirt from the Gallery
Thinkin' that he charged up, knock out his batteries
Why they mad at me? I put the work in
Once they spot a wave, they gon' try to surf in
Once they spot a wave, they gon' try toâ€” Alright, look
I left they face sour from defeat
Huh, if money equals power, then you weak
You do not got cheese, been around a couple G's
You a motherfuckin' lame, ham, clown, and a dweeb
If it ain't got no age, that account bound to freeze
Tried to lock us out the game 'til the gang found the keys
Get you knocked off silent, I ain't gotta shout and scream
