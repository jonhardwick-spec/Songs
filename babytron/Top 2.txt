[Intro]
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
Ooh, Sav killed it
[Verse 1: Since99]
'Bout to order Thai takeout, you eating Hot Pockets
I'm a well known Neiman stepper, you a Hot Topic
99, StanWill and Tron, we some walking buckets
Middle finger to a random stranger, I'm a walking fuck it
They was tryna take the hustle out me, had to cut 'em off
Double cross, tore his ACL, had to walk it off
Paying for promotion only reason that you popping off
Only time I'm fucking on your bitch is when it's in a loft
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Told the plug say no more, I'ma cop 'em all
Unkie got some shit for yo Titi that'll lock her jaw
If we beefing, ain't no fighting, gotta get the chops involved
Somerset shopper, eight hundred on some socks and drawers
2016, was upping ten up on Periscope
Every time I'm in the function, bitches be like, "There he go"
Used to get up, now you don't, you like Derrick Rose
Would've hit his ass with the pump but the barrel broke
[Verse 3: Since99 &
BabyTron
]
Hoes tryna rock some dirty Forces, that is not cute
BabyTron and Since99, they say we top two
Always acting funny for the net, that is not you
Reach for this chain? We gon' blow him like some hot soup
Reach for this chain? We gon' turn him into angel dust
Why this bitch playing dumb? She know that I came to fuck
I just-I just-I just really want the neck out you, ain't came to bust
2018, young Tron had some major thrust
2013, A. Bennett, you a major bust
Told my cousin if he catch a body, he can hang with us
Sign him to a 10-day if he tryna play with us
Overseas, up in Euro, shit, I'm getting paper cuts
