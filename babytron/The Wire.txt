It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga

[Chorus: Prince Jefe &
BabyTron
]
Broke up with my bitch, I'm cookin' zips, can get another one
I'm workin' my shoulder and my wrist to scrape a hundred-plus
Catch a nigga lackin', up my blick and drop a honey bun
Why you sittin' with your hands out? Go get some money, bumShit, it's time to throw the wires on the wire
Fishtailin' in Pirellis
, you see fire on the tires
Up the score, we in the finals, slam a bitch, but don't do titles
Akhi too precise with rifles, now your mans need a revival
[Verse 1: Prince Jefe]
No interruption, I'm in here makin' a brick
He ain't die, but he paralyzed, we made that boy a crip
But don't ask me who I'm with, we slide right past and lеt it hit
I got fiends chasin' the dragon, this new dopе right here the shit
Hell nah, I don't got no plan on savin' these hoes
Put the pole on his old-ass unc', what you on?
Nigga rappin' like he sellin' bricks, I think he lyin', though
I hit your town, a thousand eight degrees and ball like Lonzo
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Cuddy, he ain't got no rap career, he slap yola (Brrt)
We don't pass 'Woods, but you might see us match sodas
I might pull up, shoot a movie like I'm Fat Sosa
How you call yourself a sipper? Never had an Act' coma (Rookie)
Shit, TRX or Shelbys, we don't do Tacomas
Kitchen like a cafeteria, it got a food aroma (Woo)
California king, I used to have to do the sofa (Man)
Yohji Yamamotos, used to do the red monkeys
