Shining like a model top, flexing like the muscle man
Never going broke, I make it stretch just like a rubber band
In the [?] like Goldilocks, crazy 'cause she used to spin
Back when I was broke, she would block my shot just like she Ben
Dump with the pin, got a fire BINWidebody, it's a smoke cloud when the tires spinPunch God, grab a CVV then I type it inRoad runners, bitch got her L's then she hired in
Feel like Weezy F., all yo baby want is a milli'Gang coming Goose attire when it's getting chillyGhetto elegance, gang and them spinning BentleysShe be mean-mugging, only right I put my bitch in Fendi
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Grinding to the top [?] main view
Show you how to get it, I can really coach Phil you
Slide with twin Glocks, fuck around and Jack and Jill you
Seen yo true colors, couldn't believe that this the real you
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
If you ain't gang, more than likely I don't feel you
Tell a bitch, "Leave with them tears, I can't heal you"
Yeah, you got some money but you lost 'cause you still you
Last night, blew a eighth of Runtz and I'm still blew
