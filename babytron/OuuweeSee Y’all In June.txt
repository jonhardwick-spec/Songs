[Verse]
The pills five something each, I quadruple 'em for the Michael Jordan
Foreigns roaring like Velociraptors, catch us Dinosaurin'
Scored a sweet 16 and drunk a 12, now I'm just final fourin'
Why she rock that purse like a Chanel? I'm sick she Michael Korsin'
Your jewelry ain't gon' hit unless you add some VFX
Spin that bitch like handlebars, I'm Dave Mirra with BMX
Pull a hundred out your ass if you want me to be impressed
Your belly full of butterflies up in that field, I'm DMX
I'm just thinking out loud
They ain't ready for the wave, they at the beach without towels
In the booth eating tracks, find a beat and chow down
I'm a king, what that mean? When you see me bow down
Ouuwee, fully switch on my 23
I got a scripts of RTA's, I'm talking blue jeans
My left pocket chicken wings, the right one blue cheese
Abracadabra with the bag, make it poof, see?
It don't ever stop from dawn to dusk, like fuck an interval
Custom Cuban link, I got my jeweler crushing minerals
Cuddy rockin' prezzi but can't tell you if he liberal
Exotic smoker, told the plug, "Don't pull up with originals"
You looking for a real bitch? You better off finding a Woolly Mammoth
Quatro pockets full, I pull it out and let the fully wam 'em
Once you burn the bridge you can't reconstruct it, that's how the cookie crumble
I'mma show em' he ain't got 9 lives, and leave that pussy humble
0 days off, I ain't Ferris Bueller
Hit 'em with the
Super-uke'n-juke
, thats a rare maneuver
Uncle Elroy, I just copped a crib in Rancho Cucamonga
150 worth of ice on me, I'm walking through a tundra
Should'a saved some stamina, you prolly would'a got farther
Shout out to the source, his price is 'bout as right as Bob Barker's
Blender be on high, I told my junky "Next time knock harder"
Usually it's Quagen Chrome, but today I'mma Wock harder
