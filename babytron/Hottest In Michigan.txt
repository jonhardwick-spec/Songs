[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
[Verse 1: Rio Da Yung OG]
Oh, your last nigga broke your heart? I can fix that
If the pussy ain't got a scent on it, I'ma lick that
I know the bitch got some good head, she got a big back
I just got two free pounds of weed, I'm finna flip that
Hundred thousand dollars for the crib, where you live at?
You in the club four days out the week, where your kids at?
Disrespectful, I'll cut into a nigga, like, "Where your bitch at?"
Guaranteed if the bitch let you fuck, I can hit that
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Break a brick down four times like a KitKat
Dude a grown-ass man, but still'll get him kidnapped
Head to toe, my 'fit on point, my neck and my wrist match
Would've thought the perky had some teeth, this bitch just bit back
We'll turn y'all kickback to a lay down, to a stay down
Slidin' down and turn your block into a playground
Used to LOL up in my comments, what's to say now?
[Verse 3: Rio Da Young OG]
Thе pinky ring I bought eight thousand dollars
I just got down, sold him eight ounces of flour
Makin' tеn racks to spit a track, you won't catch me 'round no powder
I'm tryna cook two bricks, though, give me 'bout an hour
I'm easily jumpin' on this beat
You ain't paid your car note in three months, you gettin' repo'ed, baby
I ain't really good at drinkin' fours, we pour eighters
I ain't never smoke one gram, bro, we roll eighth-ies
Left the crib broke, came back with a hundred, I'm a hero, baby
I could put ten phones in your name if you was zero, maybe
