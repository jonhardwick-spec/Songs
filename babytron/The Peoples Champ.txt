[Intro: YSR Gramz]
(
Enrgy made this one

Nigga, I feel like
I gotta say it like RMC Mike
Bitch
[Verse 1: YSR Gramz]
I'm big boolin'
If my granny send the drank to you, we gon' get into it
A nigga tryna get down on me, he must think I'm stupid
Oh, he sell a lotta drugs? He think he Frank Lucas
Dumb-ass nigga gon' snitch, the police run into him
Dumb-ass nigga gon' get blitzed if we run into him
We got ARs and FNs, we ain't runnin' from him
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Ayy, okay
I don't run from shit, but run out Chase if the check bounce
Punched a lil' room, smoked it out and I ain't check out
Playin' both sides, gon' fuck around and blow the ref down
You talkin' 'bout some wop, but, lil' bitch, what that head 'bout?
Only been to Flint once, I really go to Beecher
You ain't never scorin', bitch, you really on the blеachers
Amiri jeans, triple S, that's rеally just to feature
This white bitch saw me and said, "That's really Justin Bieber"
