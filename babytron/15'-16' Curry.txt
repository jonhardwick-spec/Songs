[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm locked in like a prisoner
In your city scoring, y'all can't stop the visitors
BabyTron
,
my name ringing bells like a solicitor
Sitting back, I don't play games like the commissioner
Me and Stan in our bag, salt and vinegar
734, fishtailing up on Whittaker
Set the flank, shooters 'round the whole perimeter
I don't think he getting up, we hit him with a finisher
I don't think he getting up, I don't think he coming back
BriansClub, YaleLodge, I pressed a hunnid pack
You ever think about some shit like crazy it'd come to that
That shit wickеd
It's four o'clock, San Fran' time, seven at thе crib
As-salamu alaykum, send him up to heaven if he pig
Real sipper, fifty Faygos, finna set 'em in the fridge
When they reach the right temp', pour a seven in the lid
[Chorus]
I just made a play by Oracle, I feel like Steph
Baby girl adorable, when she suck dick, I might just stretch
The run we on historical
, y'all lil' boys, y'all just be Jeff
It be horrible when y'all be 'round the hoes tryna impress
I just made a play by Oracle, I feel like Steph
Baby girl adorable, when she suck dick, I might just stretch
The run we on historical
, y'all lil' boys, y'all just be Jeff
It be horrible when y'all be 'round the hoes tryna impress
