[Intro]
I'm so high, I don't even know how the fuck I'm standing up
No fakin'
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, long live $cam, you know?
[Verse]
Tossin' bullets out the window, we ain't littering
I'll flick the switchy on this blicky for that bickering
On, off, on, off, his light just be flickering
Bitch talking 'bout she wanna link, let me consider it
Working on another mission, cuz help me deliver it
Fuck a papercut, I thumb so much, my fingers blistering
Booted times two, I'm off a yerky in my Timberlands
Bitch so cold, the way she ride me, I be shivering
Ain't a thing different, it's ramen still simmering
Marni monster activated, my ho rockin' Zimmerman
Pale buckеt hat, look like a fisherman
Catch a body with the .23, now Jason Richardson
Diamonds glittеring, boy, get from 'round me, you be slithering
Throw a muzzle on the ARP, this lil' bitch whispering
At the mailbox, I'm catching P's like I'm a pop filter
Rose gold, white gold, two tone, this not silver
Should've kept her hands off my shit, I think my pop killed her
I'm from where we turning 3D printers into Glock builders
Yerks got me feeling like I dove into some poison oak
Crazy, just for me to touch the court, had to annoy the coach
If you on our way, get out the way, better avoid the boat
Buying everything for all the times back when my toys was broke
You as lit as a wet matchbook
Militia meeting, putting dates on the next ambush
Talkin' 'bout you eating good, but that chef can't cook
If the blicky jam, show you how my left hand look
Tell your mans pay his bills, now he beefing with the repo man
Couple hours counting cheese, done ended up with Cheeto hands
Couple G's over a couple P's, we got a kilogram
Tell a ho, "I want the neck above, so you can keep your pants"
You rock bedazzled Ed Hardy
Not me, I went to Hutch and bedazzled ten Cartis
Zotti man pulled up with the flavors, Applehead Smarties
Put an opp on the news, then throw a Channel 10 party
I'm so stingy with the Quagen, you can't get a capful
10K for the hoodie, half silk, half wool
You half-ham, half-burger
Cuddy he a crack server, dirtied up the back burners
In Ohio state, buck-eyed, lookin' for them troopers
Still haven't touched five, you lookin' like a loser
Teach a lesson with the Drakey, clip is looking like a ruler
Hundred percent from the field, I'm looking like a shooter
