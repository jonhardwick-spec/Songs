[Intro: G.T.]
Primo, turn this shit upIt's Lando, yo bitch know, don't let yo bitch go, nigga
Come on
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, nigga
[Verse 1: G.T.]
The road was trapping like a short bus, I feel special ed
If I let my sleeve roll up, she gon' give me head
Corvette black on black but the inside's read
When you getting real money, everybody call you friend
Next day I'm fresh as hell, probably jumping out the Benz
Hit her and her friend? I don't know, it depends
Saw this shit clear like I had on a lens
Three thousand for the jacket, two racks for my pants
The pants made in Paris, I ain't nevеr been to France
The jacket UNDERCOVER, it camе straight from Japan
I'm backing up Tron, on the site buying BINs
Hit the store, jam twice, green light, they some hams
Niggas talk down but they really be some fans
I ain't vote but the Prezi on my left hand
I'm on fire like it's NBA Jam
Hit your block broad day with six drums like a band
I left the strap in the whip but you'll get hit with a bomb
I bet you full-blown rap but she shaped like a model
I ain't even hit the gas yet, I'm going full throttle
I'm tryna my whole arm in the pot, nigga, Vince Carter
