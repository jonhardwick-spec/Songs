[Intro: $camaurion]
72, ayy, 72
Start that, yeah, from the
Fresh out the gate with it
(
Ayy, Envy, make me one
)
Fuck
[Verse 1: $camaurion]
Bitch, it's big 72, I'm feeling rude as hell
Bitch, I got all rude on shoes, YSL
Boy, you couldn't even fuck with me back in the Pelle Pelle
(Gang up from when the nigga sick, he couldn't bail)
(Nigga sipping yellow lean, sick you came snail)
Shit, I'm in Portland, Dame Lillard, left a flame trail
It's a couple niggas I don't fuck with, but they all dead
Bitch, I'm at the set, I'm in the mall shopping for fall shit
They like, "$cam, what you been on?", I can't call it
Feds say I was sliding in the stores, I don't recall shit
I asked your bitch, do shе know some French? I'm in Burberry Brit
I told Tron, "Wе can't trust shit, we might just send a blitz"
[Chorus: $camaurion]
They like, "$cam, what you been on?" I can't call it
They like, "$cam, what you been on?" I can't call it
(They like, "$cam, what you been on?" I can't call it)
Feds say I was sliding in the stores, I don't recall shit
They like, "$cam, what you been on?" I can't call it
They like, "$cam, what you been on?" I can't call it
(They like, "$cam, what you been on?" I can't call it)
Feds say I was sliding in the stores, I don't recall shit
