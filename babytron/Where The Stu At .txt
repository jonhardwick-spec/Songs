[Intro: StanWill]
Bitch
While I run it up, bro gon' walk you down

Huh, yeah
[Verse: StanWill &

Neck cost a car, wrist cost a house
Kicks cost your rent, use these hoes to kick your lil' bitch outPop cost your stash, you better not even pour a little bit out
Pay a ho to do my laundry, that's just how I'm livin' now
Blew four thousand on this 'fit, boy, let me spin around
Five thousand just to pull up on the plug and get a poundSix thousand, they finna ship 'em out
Quarterback the play, told brodie get in route
Chilly in these streets, it's Marni sweater weather
Can't take nothing less, we beefing, we want you dead or better
Bitch, I play with heavy cheese and you got feather cheddar
Funny, he don't never leave the crib, boy, is your stepper tethered?
Dawg a rape duckerI can't blame him, though, I'm ridin', slidin' with some head bustersAnd a couple baddiesThanks to these setup hoes, we got a couple addiesTime to spin the drop, time to spin the block, they still hidin'Couple years ago I got these pendants and they still shinin'And I upped the collectionHe was stuck actin' tough, now he just stuck up in Heaven
If you see me out, was probably with more baddies than Natalie
If I catch my favorite opp, you know I'm happily slappin' him
Tried to pull up in that striker, now a Scatty a tragedy
Multiplied our blicks, we find out where he at, we subtractin' him
Woke up with your bitch, boy, she got the boot fast
Only thing my bitch missin' is a new ass
Dropped out of college, you know, so like
Like, first on Delta the only time I ever do class
Think the AMG done grew some wings the way I flew past
Catch a opp and pop his ass quick the way I do tags
Told my ho to get in time-out 'cause you know you bad
Out on Ocean Drive, I'm lookin' up like, where my roof at?
Punched him with the blicky, got him askin' where his tooth atFuckin' on his bitch, I got him askin' where his boo atShe done blew my fuse, got me askin' where my shoes atShit, I heard that I don't shoot, it got me askin' where the hoop atI just bark to the Militia, I ain't askin' where the troops atOT with some shit to say, it got me askin' where the stu' atWhere the booth at? Where the truth at?All he does is hat, cap, and jeff, where's the proof at?Quarter of the zottarooni got me where the moon at
