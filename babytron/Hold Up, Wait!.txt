[Verse 1]
I can't do no North Face unless Supreme on the coat
Thousand dollar double cup, I spilled some lean on the floor
I might pop out Mike Amiris off Celine on the ho
Unky in it knee deep, can tell a fiend by his nose
Backdoor season, you won't hear me creeping out the door
Heard that one shit back going, finna buy some pros
Looking like I'm playing Minecraft, all these diamonds on
Blowing Cookie from the middle shelf, oh, you kind of blow
On Middlebelt with some pings tryna find a store
High as hell without no shoes on, I tried to tie my toes
Huh, nah, I'm playing
Plug talking 'bout, "Come back tomorrow," nah, I'm staying
Hit your block with two chops, thеy gon' have to caution tape it
Unky cooking in the kitchеn, damn near tossed dog an apron
Since your mans a hellhound, we gon' send dog to Satan
Palm Angels nine hundred, I am not jogging basic
The backpack full of fifties, but the pants off the Franklins
You ain't no player, you a mascot
Eating lambchops with my gang from the sandbox
Two-five-eight, three-six-five, this shit can't stop
Mister do the white buffs sipping on a black pop
Pop a V-cut and turn into a different monster
Bitch play with me, I'm pullin' up and spittin' on her
This a big chopper, it look like a missile launcher
2022, I know my cheese getting longer (No hat)
I only blow thrax
You broke, where the joke at?
Paid a whole rack for the coat on the coat rack
Heard you seen your opps and didn't blow, you a ho, jack
Probably off a jugg device, you see my phone cracked
Finna hit the clerk with a punch like I'm
Roman Reigns
You said that you the plug, what you sold today?
Little brodie bad as hell, can barely even hold the K
Shit fucked up, but it's life, I can't show the pain
I can pearl a 'Wood in thirty seconds, fuck a rolling tray
Dropped a check in a ham Chase and now they owe the bank
ShittyBoyz galactic
, fuck around and do a show in space
I'm high as hell, I need a drink like, hold up, wait
