[Intro: BabyTron]
Huh, yeah, okay
Three-five, two Backwoods, one-seven each (
It's Bluestrip, baby
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Three-five, two Backwoods, one-seven each
Rolling sevens on the dice side, I made a seven piece
Punch and ball, bitch, I'm feeling like I'm Metta Peace
AR with the legs, crawl up on you like a centipede
Real card cracker, I ain't never sold amphetamines
Finna go in store, how much you wanna bet it ping?
Triple S, B22, you cannot step with mе
At Bucharest for my foreign bitch, she Lеbanese
Huh, and I feel like Ray Lewis, I'm a sack chaser
Huh, Roman Reigns with yo bitch, I'm a back breaker
Huh, get the ball down court, I'm a fast breaker
Good Coney in the AM but it's crab later
Your opinion doesn't matter, you don't have paper
Four phones, finna touch, I'm a jack chaser
On the Lodge back to back, looking like some drag racers
Feel like Kane with this fire on me, I think Stan 'Taker
[Verse 2: TrDee]
In the big league, let it pop like some bubble gum
Back to back plays, hit a store then another one
Knew I smelled pussy when I heard the opps was in the room
Ain't no basketball, choppa sweep 'em like a fucking broom
Three-fifth of this'll have you higher than giraffe nuts
Really came from nothing, I been humble, I don't brag much
Fucking Saks up till the point the bags drags us
Everybody got some money now, put that cash up
I sleep with a camera just to watch my surroundings
Tuning out the dick suckers and you know they lil' comments
You ain't seen what I seen, if you could, you'd probably vomit
You still chasing hoes, I started chasing after Sonic
Up the strap then I take action, I think I'm a verb
What's the point in dropping diss songs they ain't never heard?
Baby, I won't say a word, you can call me "Ferb"
You can really get it, just tell me what's the magic word
