[Hook: BabyTron]
I heard we some hoes? That really ain't this
Posted confirmations but it really ain't ship
Let me find out you bought a bag and really ain't hit
Talk my shit, play my role, I really ain't shit
Ha-ha, yeah, we really ain't shit
Why trust a bitch when you know they really ain't shit
Come around now that I'm up? They really ain't shit
They really ain't shit but we really up shit
[Verse 1: StanWill]
If ShittyBoyz ain't up, the sky ain't either
Ball for all the times I couldn't, now I can't take breathers
Hibachi when I'm out, I ain't never been a steak eater
Known to keep a sleeve on me, something like I hate jitters
25/8, I wouldn't even take a hour out
Was a sweetheart but I do the ho sour now
Shooter with me, I ain't wasting time at the Powerhouse
Charged up with the hands, bro'll knock his power out
Twenty-five letters 'cause I'm focused on the M
I got tired of the L's, now I'm focused on the wins
Pray to God every night that he don't focus on my sins
'Cause I did a lot of dirt, you know I'm focused on the BINs
We ain't made the same, you couldn't walk in my Balenciagas
I'm yo plug plug, I got more sauce than an enchilada
Say the wrong words, you getting smoked like some marijuana
Chop ain't just for shoulders, bitch be singing like Frank Sinatra
