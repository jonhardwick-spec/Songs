[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Poured three lines into my pop, shit, I think I'm finna go to sleep
You ain't had no money for the lease, so you stole the beat
Moose with the fur, you slow as hell, think the coat a mink
Why the hell you spendin' all your pape', don't you owe some cheese?
Said you up a hundred, grab a cap from the hat rack
Hellcats back to back, you might see a Scatpack
Walk 'em down, tuh-tuh, shit, that's that
Scam god'll make a quick ten off a Cash App
[Verse 2: Skilla Baby]
All my hoes freaky and Keke, I choke 'em
I heard the opps rap, before they pop, I'ma smoke 'em
Had to hit his ass with a bullet, he was open
Fuck rap, my niggas really got rich rollin'
Lil' bro just went to juvie, he a hot boy
Bro say he don't want no Ruger, he a Glock boy
If you see me ridin' in the Dodge car, that's my toy
Before my nigga TeeJaee say it, GlockBoyz, nigga
[Verse 3: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
Ayy, back to the basics, I'm like fuck niggas
Get to clutchin' out in public, if I was you, I wouldn't mug, nigga
I had her scammin', runnin' in and out of stores, I ain't even hug her
Back to the basics, I'll kill your ass for nothin', I'm like fuck niggas
If I expose shit, I made twenty last night, that shit was easy
Man, I'll never fuck that bitch, her hair be lookin' like Peezy's
I been told you I was the one, y'all niggas ain't believe me
Man, believe me, I just walked inside the jeweler and told him freeze me
