What up, Skilla?
You cut up on this bitch, JAY C
You cut up on this one, JAY C
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
White boy'll pull up sharpshootin' like I'm Larry Bird
Flyin' off the Wocky, spillin' drop on every turn
Roll an eighth, spark it up and watch the cherry burn
Forty on my neck, it's R.I.P. Hutch, ain't go to Gary, nerd
Christians on my feet, demon bitch, she ridin' passenger
Tell her put her head down since she actin' bad
We cannot compete, you work a job and ain't the manager
Blew a dub, now I'm walkin' out of Saks draggin' bags
Twenty shows and they all sold out
Brodie paranoid off Perkies, he just whipped the pole out
Unky in Kentucky for the Derby, beat the road down
I don't pop Xans, the Wock' got mе slowed down
You know what they say, what goes around comеs around
MSR embosser, Young Tron was fuckin' up your town
We ain't stoppin' no time soon, I'ma run it up for now
I'ma run it up for now, I'ma run it up for— yeah (
Huh

[Verse 2: Skilla Baby]
I'm so good at gettin' rich, it ain't shit to send a blitz
Five thousand every fit, when I sin, I repent
Slid on the opps in the Raptor, Gary Trent
Five hundred thousand on me, 'bout to count up every cent
Two hundred thousand to my jeweler, got back everything I spent
It's so hard for me to keep these bitches off me like lint
Pistol whippin' with the glizzy, man, this bitch gon' leave a dent
Turn to a rapper when I throw the buffs on, I'm Clark Kent
I be real fuckin' humble 'til these niggas make me mad
I love City Girls, I wanna fuck Yung Miami real bad
Put a hemi engine on my bag, this shit goin' fast
Man, I got some gas that'll get you higher than some gas
Started on my knuckles, man, I'm really on my feet now
BabyTron, we gon' fuck the city up when we drop
I just made her climax, I put my chain on her G-spot
Seen the opps, SpotemGottem, chopper hit 'em with the beatbox
Come on, man, I did so much shit I don't brag about
Really ran some dog shit up in my hand-me-downs
We don't do no drive-bys, we do walk-'em-downs
Security, let me beat his ass before you toss him out, huh
