[Verse]
Yeah, my life is wonderful, but that don't mean I'm comfortable
You might see it black and white, but he might see it colorful
Believin' anything they tell you, you so gullible
And yeah, I got some cheese, I'm crunchin' on the side like Lunchables
When brodie tote that .38, he feel untouchable
Yellow tape him, put his family on the TV like the Huxtables
I'm feelin' indestructible, the juice got me dysfunctional
And bein' down don't last forever, that shit, it's adjustable
ARP'll turn his hairstyle to the Doodie Lo
TrDee my dookie bro, we played with cards since Yu-Gi-Oh (Swear)
Brodie ate him with the chopstick, it ain't Xushi Ko
When the score go up, I do the Foolio like Julio
You be sippin' champagne, I be rosin' at the jewelry store
The way these bitches acting, you would think they playing movie roles
Acting like he had exotic and pulled up with pookie 'bow
Voyage was fantastic off the shrooms, I feel like Coolio
Wake up, Bathing Ape
Hit the road and face an eighth
8AM, I'm making plays
Get up, go, can't take a break
You ain't tryna race for chicken, Ricky Bobby, Shake n Bake
Spot don't never close, pull up whenever, it's like Steak 'n Shake
Only reason that you dripping, got your fit off Klarna
Guarantee she still gon' catch you if you dip on karma
Brodie said he ever fall off, he gon' have to hit the Garda
Delta One, I'm flying in a bed from LA to LaGuardia
Super smacked,
I just poured two fours, Miguel Cabrera
All that capping that you doing, might as well go sell New Era
Yeah, my arms, I'm finna bear 'em, run up, got the right to air em
Said you payin' what for jacks? Let me go run it by my Arabs
The flower that I'm rollin' up alludes to a cardoon
I can guess his outfit 'fore I see him, he a cartoon
Thinking he got golden VS1s, he rocking jargoon
Think he swimming 'round the deep untouched, I got a harpoon
You can't see my bitch, she in the lead like Angel Reese
Brother turned to Cain, but that's alright, won't let him Abel me
Nope, I'm the Undertaker
Boy, I'm with the troublemakers
I'll pop out like I'm Kylo Ren, stick got a double laser
If I ever finished college, would've got the hustle major
Bet we get to chewin' like some gum, these fullies bubble breakers
Everybody asking me for one, I'm trying to juggle favors
Tryna stack it to the ozone, told her we can cuddle later
Why you tryna solve a puzzle you ain't got the pieces for?
All this shit that's floatin' through my mind, come on, just keep recording
Yeah, I'm eating Morton's, not to mention what I drink a fortune
Yeah, I might catch 'em out of town, I might catch 'em here
Tryna catch up to this whip, gon' need an extra gear
Tryna catch up to the kid, gon' need some extra years
You can't even hide it, pussy, I can smell the fear
