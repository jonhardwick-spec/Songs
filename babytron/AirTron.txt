[Intro]
I ain't playing basketball, but pull up
— uh
Basketball (
Ayo, Mark A
)
Damn, huh
[Verse 1]
I ain't playing basketball, but I'll pull up, shoot something
Feel like Wilt, if I up the blues, that's a cool hunnid
Twenty-three on me in Atlanta, feel like Lou Hudson
Star
player, leave the crowd packed and the roof jumping
Bet I hit a jumper if I see an opp today
Ankle breaker, getting shifty, they gon' have to stop the play
It's kinda hard for you to score 'cause you ain't really got a lane
Amar'e Stoudemire
, walked up into Hutch then copped the frames
Told bro, "Let's get a bucket", run a pick and rollMatter fact, I think they hit to it, run a givе 'n' go
Whole 'nother book full of plays if they switch thе zones
Dream Team type shit, the whole team getting gold (Yeah)
Any problem?
I'll handle it like Kyrie
Thousand dollar kicks, give a fan a pair of signed sneaks
Shit talker, play a dirty game, they might fine me
Treat the jeweler like a trainer, tell him, "Ice me"
Ain't no rim grazing, windmilling
like I'm
Dominique (Sheesh)
SB, the franchise, you cannot defeat (SB)
Told bro to pass to me, shit, I'm hot as GreeceMVP this season, just watch and see
I was rookie of the year 2019
(Fuck, swish, swish)
Call lil' brodie Tony Allen, he'll take the charge
This shit out to the wing got me playing guard
Call a timeout, then put some Wocky in my Gatorade
You don't wanna see me ball, what you drinking? Hatorade?
I know you sick you sitting in the crowd watching players play
Courtside in Crypto, finna sit and watch the Lakers game
(Swear to God)
Smoking Scottie Pippen in a pair of Mikes
If it's up, boy, I'm Gerald Green, heard you scared of heights
Shit, behind the back, Jason Williams
Need a max contract, I'm out here chasing billions
Scam Man, I'm out here grabbing bricks like I'm KG
How I'm feeling, I'm the top pick, feel like AD
Hit him from the corner, chop got reach like KD
Rap star, tryna own a team like I'm JAY-Z
BabyTron, you might catch me on the jumbotron
Whoever standing in the paint is who I'm dunking on
Squad on my back but it's cool, boy, I'm clutch as Bron
Tron Stockton, every game you gon' see a couple lobs
(Double-double type shit)
Shit, I'm waiting on the mailman right now (Karl)
Should eject you from the game, your whole life foul
CJ McCollum, pull up shooting, lights out
