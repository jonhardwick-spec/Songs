[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Audemars Piguet, I blew it out, it ain't for tellin' time
Somethin' 'bout that codeine when it blend in with the lemon-lime
Somethin' 'bout them dollars when they get inside my palm
High as hell, talkin' to demons, I can't tell my rights from wrongs
Thoughts flowin' out my brain, you won't catch me write a song
Three-five, three-seven, you won't catch me light a bong
'Rilla on my hoodie, bitch, I'm a king like I'm Kong
Bing to the bong, ding to the dong
Got your bitch hypnotized, bet she sing to my song
Old pussy-ass jit, you probably bleed through your thong
Shout-out Icebox, you see bling to the blaow
Scorin' like I'm Kobe Bryant, takin' beans out of town
Sippin' Wock' in Poland like I'm Boat, this lean, can't pronounce
I'm known north to west, I'm known east to south
In a California king, remember dreams on the couch
They ain't seen a ring in years, shit, they team on a drought
If I pop a V-cut, it's gon' be steam I let out
I'ma call you Oscar, sippin' green lean, you a grouch
And your whole life trash
They think they got they site secure, I bet I bypass
If the clerk don't know his job, he get a right jab
Fell asleep for two days with my high ass
Live in the moment, sip slow, but I drive fast
We don't believe a word you say 'cause you cry wolf
The spot Gordon Food Service, pull up, buy bulk
CVVs, punches green, I feel like Hulk
Marni fuzzy than a bitch, it feel like wool
Heavy threats, can't compare to your light pull
Pourin' red, my pop black, we ball like Bulls, I'm '93 Jordan
See the so-called MVP in the finals and keep scorin'
Steering wheel on the right side, bitch, the sleeve foreign
Opps so scared of beef, they probably don't even eat Morton's
Throw a hook, then sign the receipt underneath, it's G. Foreman
Oh, you got a three poured? Every time I dream, it's lucid
Broke 'cause you scared to take a risk, like, how you think this stupid?
Trisha got me movin' .5 speed, I'm sleepin', droolin'
Hundred steps ahead at all times like all I think's conclusions
Why you post that eater on your story? You just bein' foolish
Why you in Kappa?
Somewhere only rockets get like I'm with NASA
There he go, I ain't sayin' shit, just click-clackin'
NFL Combine, we had 'em zig-zaggin'
Talkin' 'bout the plug, you ain't even on brick status
Out in Hollywood, I think I'm finna Fifths Ave it, I'm a Saks fanatic
Came out in a thousand-dollar 'fit to just go grab a package
How I'm workin' magic, you would think I got a hat with rabbits
First name Jack, not no Black, I be Apple stackin'
Stop flashin' that, can't grab a jacket from the Fashion District
