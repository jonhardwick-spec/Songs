[Intro]

If you chose, you ain't gotta choose
I swear you don't
Just let greatness happen, you know?
Let it come to you
But you gotta work for it at the same time, I swear
ShittyBoyz
Huh, yeah
[Chorus]
You gon' fake it, still might not even make it, yeah, yup
All this pain got me facin', can't take it, woah, woah
Nah, his hand, I can't shake it, he snakin', no, no
Close my eyes, I see Franklins on Franklins, aha
Uppin' on the 'Gram, I'm making a statement
No, had them sticky situations, make 'em or break 'em
Uh-uh, he can't get away, gon' chase him like Jason
Powered up, once they see this, bet they change in the rankings
[Verse 1]
Mm-hmm, sick of Earth, today, I'm playin' in the spaceship
Fah-fah, thirty rounds left his brains on the pavement
Bro damn near immune to Percs, now he just take 'em to take 'em
Built a line around the block, I guess the patience stay stationed
Doggy actin' like the cops, he must get paid by the station
Put this bitch in R and do the full, I'm shaking and baking
Out-of-towners pay outrageous prices, take 'em to Dayton
Shoutout to my mama and my pops, created some greatness
Got a chimpanzee on my shoulders, that's some drank, let me taste it
Poured a tray, I can't waste it, this an A if they grade it
Keep a tool like I'm maintenance, I don't care if I'm famous
We tryna get rich, you know?
