[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Experimentin' in the lab, turned my Sprite into a root beer
Summertime Rhude, but the winter, it be Goose gear
[Verse 2: TrDee]
In here with the gang, you not official, where your stripes at?
Choke her just like Bart when we fuckin' 'cause she like that
[Verse 3: YSR Gramz]
Fucked around and took me some shrooms, I gotta fight back
He was sneak dissin' on the 'Gram and got his life snatched
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Jack Sparrow, keep a cannon on me, need an eyepatch
Akhi pop out with that K, they think it's Iraq
[Verse 5: GrindHard E]
Dropped the lo', we killed everybody, they couldn't slide back
Bitch ain't wanna give me head while I was drivin', made her drive back
[Verse 6: BabyTron]
I ain't got no sauce for the jacks, I'm grabbin' iPads
He ain't got no pape' for a zip, he grabbin' dimebags
Thinkin' that his BoA secured, just watch me bypass
Thinkin' that his Scat Pack fast, watch me fly past
Would've thought my eye black, buffs, they on ice pack
