Yeah, ayy, ayy, yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah
[Chorus: youngsixflags]
Ayy, sipping on a crisp white, nigga
I ain't coming off the bench, I ain’t a six guy, nigga, nah
Fit crispy than a french fry, nigga
With my migos right now, but I'ma get right with you, yeah
[Verse 1: youngsixflags]
We them boys, ain't talking Wiz, but we be toking though
Catch me rolling by the lake, I’m in the Poconos
These niggas capping, straight puppets, all Pinocchios
He asked me for a feature, hit him with the "Okey doke"
He smoke, he smoke, he smoke, he smoke, we all be smoking though
How the fuck you gon' go and claim that you a real one when you broke the code?
Since the day I came in this bitch, I've been real, it's in my chromosomes
Why you talking 'bout owning Rollies though when we all know you broke?
Girl Scout Cookies in my blunt, we blowing Do-Si-Dos
Pockets on Al Roker, then I hit him with the rope-a-dope
Disney Channel on 'em, making magic, this that hokus pok'
Word to SZA, all my niggas 'round me showing no control
Been that nigga, I’ma be that nigga, no capperton
Niggas hear me bar up and be like, "I won’t rap again"
Shout out to my niggas in the Yay, mane, what's hannenin’?
See these clowns, but that's my favorite fish like Gus Dapperton
