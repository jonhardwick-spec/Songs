[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy (
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse 1]
Do the dash in a Scat, fly it like a X-wing
Bitch, I'm Mr. Pull Up To The Bank And Make The Check Ping
Back to back champ, yo team losing like the tenth seed
I'll cut the traction off and make the 'Vette squeak
Ksubi jean rocker, riding 'round with some bean poppers
Everybody five plus, we don't do the team hoppers
Scam vet, 2016, I would've green dot her
7.62s demolish shit, this a tree chopper
Punching like a boxer, I don't box but we can box you up
Three five of Jelly Bean Pie, taking toxic puffs
How is you the source? Placed an order, you ain't got enough
Dog Shit Militia, cracking cards got my pockets stuffed
Made some shit off that one shit, shoutout Donald Trump
Samsung freezer, ten minutes, turn the Wock' to slush
I
t's gon' be a long night if I pop the trunkGrab a coat, it's a cold night when I rock the buffs
[Bridge]
You didn't know? It's time to get to it
Bro hitting whippits, clutching Glocky in this bitch zooted
Real shooter, only swish too
Tool got a ladder, hit his crib tryna improve it
