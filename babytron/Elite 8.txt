[Verse 1: Prince Jefe]
Pocket full of Nipseys, but I'm seein' red
I'm sendin' chickens on the road, hope I don't see the feds
Can get a quarter ticket out this shit, it's all 'bout how you play it
Caught him at the red light, rocked his ass to bed
It's a celebration, we just boxed him in
You get a location, I might let you in
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Say they with you from the start, they switchin' in the end
You a shrimp, my niggas sharks, I'm swimmin' with the fin
Big FN on my waist got my posture funny
Cut into her like a surgeon, I got doctor money
All that muggin' like you tough'll get you popped for nothin'
Skinny, but I'm Jorgen Von Strangle when I rock the buffies
[Verse 3: LOM Rudy]
When it comе to mixin', I'm a wizard like I'm Brad Beal
Big bag, get thе quickest loan like I'm Dan Gil'
I done sold a lot of pills, not no Advils
All my boys shittin' on these niggas like I'm StanWill
I got on Supreme, not the one 50 beefin' with
Sometimes, I think my brother blind 'cause he keep a stick
