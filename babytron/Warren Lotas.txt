Enrgy made this one

Yeah
[Verse 1: $camaurion]
Shit, I woke up glad as hell the Wocky came back
How you ballin' for the gang? You got the same stats
Just upped a roll in your peep, that's the same cash
Rude as hell with RHUDE on, lookin' for the bag
I might just run up in your trap lookin' for the stack
Slidin' up in Walmart, bro like, "Where your map?"
Ask a nigga what he bang, I'm lookin' for his flag
You ain't really droppin' checks, the account's gettin' flagged
Broke as hell, you tryna punch but can't get no tracks
Got a crazy-ass run, your shit overlapped
Just got a Navy in the Bay, I'ma run it back
Niggas broke for the 'Gram, all they do is cap
Bro, he sittin' in the front, I just popped a Zack
Fuckin' with the Cash App, finesse you out your bag
Fuckin' with the Turbo Tax, finesse you out a band
I'm on the way to LAX, I'll call you when I land
Jugg a nigga out his rent, I feel like Uncle Sam
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Warren Lotas wrapped around my legs, I rock expensive pants
Thirty 'bows around while Turkey in the kitchen pressin' Xans
At the gallery, a twenty bags, I need an extra hand
Lookin' at your 'fit, I'm startin' to think you never spent a band
I ain't foldin', only thing that bend is the Striker
Out in Cali, see the opps and bend in a Viper
It's sixteen, I made my first ten with a writer
Poppin' out Five-SeveN, mix FN with designer
The last thing he saw through them lens was some fire
Holy shit, fuck
Pull up to the function when I want, bitch, I don't get rushed
Presi' with the chunks, I'm finna go and get my wrist bust
Heard he just died, roll him up, he finna get stuffed
Look, I just touched down in the Bay like a 49er
Why you got that lil' Glock? Bro a forty-fiver
Droppin' shots on the opp block, the hoop court retired
