ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
[Chorus]
Rather keep it to myself, I got so much bottled up (I got so much bottled up)
Hold the Presi' up like I just got elected, call me Tronald Trump ('Tron for president, dumbass)
Up the Mickey Mouse on a goofy, he gon' turn to Donald Duck
(Brrrt, fa-fa, fa-fa)
I ain't even post the jewelry I been droppin', better follow Hutch (Follow Hutch)
Acting bougie, you a freaky frog, lil' ho, you swallow nut (You swallow nut)
[Verse]
Hate a grown man that's always crying like a female (Female)
Blocked the bitch number, she done hit me on my Gmail (Gmail)
Smacked thе curb while I was pourin' drank, I need a detail
Thirty-city tour, tickets sеllin' out on presale (Presale)
Doggy broke as fuck, he couldn't make it out with free bail
Dog Shit Militia, when it's war, I bet we prevail
I can pearl up anything, don't matter if the leaf stale
Lil' bitch fast as hell, her pussy got a V12 (Skrrt)
'Clava off the gloves, you'd think I'm lookin' for a ski trail (Ski trail)
Livin' like a shark, when I grow old, I'm gon' have sea tails (Sea tails)
You be gettin' taxed, I just paid less than retail (Used to pay, like, triple what the fuck I pay, don't hate)
Quarter in a lil' leaf, the capacity's maxed
Not no Mike Amiri jeans, like, nah, these some Alchemy pants (Alchemy pants)
Refuse to go back broke, gotta manage these racks
Team stacked, you would think we had a fantasy draft (Fantasy draft)
Always hatin' me, 'til one day, they was randomly fans (Randomly fans)
Cuddy in the pot, you thinkin' Granny done candied the yams
Tryna slime me out, I'm hoping your strategy's planned (Strategy's planned)
Fuck the backdoor, I'm through the front like a battering ram
Fuck it, I'm finna give the rap game some CPR (Phew)
My life been a movie since we watched 'em on the VCR (VCR)
Bitch actin' like she in a foreign, that's her titi car
Thinkin' that she poppin' out trim, but that's her titi scarf
Somewhere on a beach with flame around, it ain't a tiki bar
Tiki Barber, runnin' through these hoes, I'm gettin' easy yards
Told her talk some money if she tryna make my weewee hard (Mhm, he-he, hmm, nyah, ayy)
We was geeked all tour, STG (Swear to God)
Woke up spillin' MPG on my FTP (Geekin')
You ain't really in the game, you just an NPC
Crazy that I'm finna make an M just off of MP3s (Ticket)
My white boy who keep a switchy look like FaZe Banks
You can't even hit a shot, elimination game Klay (Lame)
His neck green like a pigeon, all them fake chains
I just spent a brick of Great Dane on a plain jane
