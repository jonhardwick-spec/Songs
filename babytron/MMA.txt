[Intro: AllStar JR]
(
Enrgy made this one

(
Ooh, Sav killed it
)
Let's get a what?
[Verse 1: AllStar JR]
Send a blitz, he seein' Ghost in the backfield
Shoot at his feet, he a ho, make him tap dance
You a dick sucker, let you tell it though, you tapped in
I'll big truck in, pedal lightly when I back in
Grab the thirty just to come out with the kids
Boy, my pop dirty as a bum under a bridge
You ain't never even touched the type of money on your head
Payin' over sticker price, my nigga only wanted ten
I'm getting 'bows on a flat bed
Came a long way from floors with the crackheads (Long way)
Might not makе a million rapping, but the trap will
So I don't give a motherfuck about no backеnd, bag life
Pay attention, show you how to cook a slab right
Way this bitch hittin', show you how to wear a flashlight
All my son tuition, counted forty thou' last night
(Bitch)
Don't go on mission, that's the niggas that's gon' crash out
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Brodie got a jack in there, we ain't talkin' off the jail phone
Catch an opp, snatch him up, and tie him to the railroad
Or pour some gas on him, spark a 'Wood, and throw it at him
Dub for a face shot, ten for an open casket
I'm talkin' hoppin' out the tree, I really know assassins
GOAT status, you can go and ask 'em
Locked in on my own island, Alcatraz
Touched down in the A, I snuck it in a Falcons bag
Walter White with it, unky cook it up like Malcom dad
Fairy-tale life, I'm just blowin' fire, draggin' bags
Get him out of here, he say whatever with his random ass
Blowin' Rasta with my ganjas, MIA in Little Haiti
Bitch said I'm crazy, I spent eighty on a lil' eighthy
Four pockets full up off the rap, I feel like Lil Baby
Backpack Celine, I grab the Birkin for my lil' lady
