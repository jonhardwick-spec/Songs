[Intro: BabyTron]
Woke up to a plan, threw my tech on
Chunky Triple S, don't get stepped on
Damjonboi
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Woke up to a plan, threw my tech on
Big-ass Triple S, don't get stepped on
Speak up, I'm out of town in a dead zone
And if it's up then it's stuck, give 'em a headstone
Touchdown, end zone, feel like Gronkowski
I could call my hitman, bitch, I'm Tronkowski
Hit the clerk with some fire, had her stop dropping
When I hit with a punch, I am not boxing
[Verse 2: TrDee]
She threw the neck, now my toes throwing gang signs
And if she ain't thick, she can't get into my line-up
Don't compare us to no niggas catching up, they still behind us
My bitch punching shit, I think I fucked a Ronda Rousey
A Ronda Rousey, tripping in the Masi
Just had a trust fall but I'm finna catch a body
When the lights getting cold, they finna deal molly
Only stick that you had, that you popped, was lolli
