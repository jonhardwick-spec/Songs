[Intro]
(
Jxckk just want a drink
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Put that bullshit out, this is za' only
I got chicken, I got cheese like some macaroni
Me and Stan got the same Glock, Zach and Cody
Don't care 'bout what you used to do, bro, you gon' have to show me
I just got to LAX, droptop weather
Talkin' 'bout you from the city, you from Rochester
Me and money go together, feel like salt and pepper
Why you be talkin' like a demon? You is not a stepper
Why niggas hatin'? I don't know, you can ask Siri
Catch me in the mall, can't take no pictures, too much bags with me
"Still fuckin' on them young hoes, oh, you Josh Giddey?"
I think that she know I'm takin' off, she tryna ride with me
You better not say I'm offbeat, I get you offed, bro
Pull up on us, we got what you need, feel like Costco
Tell your mans to duck it 'fore we hit him in his taco
Baby, if you love me, open up a Wells Fargo
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Aim it at his top and get his noodles baked
Ballin' now, remember all them two a days
Walkin' out the bank, I got the bluest pape
Niggas think I went and shot my watch the way I blew the face
Every time I see the red and blue, I race
Doggy category fiction, everything he doin' fake
When we get that lo', I bet his spot look like a shooting range
I just heard your baby in the station doin' Q&As
Doggybone a rat, he finna tell it all
Tryna make it hit while unc' and them, they tryna sell it all
She gon' rip my collar off, your bitch done met a dog
You know you can't play with gang and them, these niggas better pause
Hm, matter fact, they better stop
Think we meetin' up to fight, lil' brodie met a Glock
Wanted to meet a rapper, your bitch met a cock
On that type of time around this bitch, you niggas better watch
