[Verse 1]
You better move out the way, DSM, it's the bullies
Nah, bitch, them ain't no fireworks, it's a fully
Pray to God for whoever sees my shotta in a hoodie
I don't think he'll get inducted, how he's living's givin' rookie
I don't think he'll make the Hall of Fame, his numbers don't reflect
Choppa stop him while he talkin', we'll— alright
Choppa stop him while he talkin', we'll punctuate his sentence
A couple thousand'll get you tortured, boy, my cousin'nem some grеmlins
Bet that bitch a ten-fifty, she was suckin' by еleven
Bitch was prom queen, now she stuffin', life's depressin'
We some kings, all that talkin' like we won't come buy you peasants
You must love gettin' robbed, this the second time you left it, tighten up
Ask a bitch, do she wanna cry in Claire's or cry in Hutch?
I was on rock bottom, but right now I'm high as fuck
Me and TrDee, we arguing 'bout who got the whitest buffs
Bitch bad, but she skinny, I might have to buy a butt
Super fried, tell a hoe it ain't no I in you
2024, these rappers buying time to lie in booths
2024, these rappers tryna fit in, buyin' views
Thinkin' we don't stand on business, 'til the gang arrived in suits
