[Verse 1: TrDee]
Look alive and keep your face up out your phone
I ain't spit a verse, she got me cummin' off the dome
I can't read no minds, you gotta tell me what you want
She gon' let me fuck 'cause I be doing what you don't
Stupid-ass bitch tryna judge me off my zodiac
Made a field goal, somebody show me where the Rollies at
Reachin' for a chain, we send his ass wherever Kobe at
Think she wanna fuck 'cause it ain't nowhere they don't know mе at
[Verse 2: Toohda Band$]
Yeah, I'm with the ShittyBoyz, but we'll gеt pissy
Pull up to the trap, baggin' packs, let's get busy
Fully switch on a G30, this my new glizzy
Bro said if we finna slide, don't use semis
These some G-Stars on my ass, I don't do Dickies
Bitch can't even touch me, she ain't payin', I don't do hickies
Free John, we was in the fin with like two fifties
I was sipping red way before I even knew Trippie
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
My headhunter from the East, I scoop her, then I shoot west
Scam, swipe, jugg, jam, ping, what I do best
Two-five-eight freeway, I don't do rest
7.62s, .223s, you gon' need two vests
Never sold a drug, bitch, I'm Mr. Drop a Fluke Check
Outta town blowing 'za, chillin' on the pool deck
Hundred-rounder, fifty-rounder, we don't really do steps
Hitman, take you out the game like you got two techs
