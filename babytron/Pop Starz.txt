[Intro: BabyTron]
RJ always tripping, man
RJ always tripping (
RJ always tripping, man
)
I'm tripping, 99 tripping
Let me take my mask off
We damn near all tripping, I wouldn’t lie
What up, RJ? (This shit is serious)
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
'Miri jeans, can't stuff a dub in them
See an opp, fuck around and stuff a slug in him
She put that pussy in the air, bro stuff the drugs in it
Fendi monster on my tee, lil’ bitch, I mug in it
[Verse 2: Since99]
Bitch, I'm toting on a Virgil hold a light 50
Choppa on me, send it to Topanga like I'm Trippie
Making all decisions, bro, this shit can get real risky
I done saw him in the bucket, boutta go and hit the jiffy
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Good with punch, BINs, but I got dumb pins
99 and them some sharks, boy, you can't just jump in
This ain't Fornite but my shooter snuck a pump in
Better use yo head 'cause 'fore you know it, it get stumped in
Skinny guy, fat shoes, I like them Triple S
Me, Stan, and Dee in Off-White, boy, that's a triple X
Turn around and make a thirty triple, that’s the triple flex
Hoes talking shit, I beat her ass so, lil’ bitch, you next
