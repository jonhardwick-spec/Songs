Turn me up stan, this the one i think

ShittyBoyz
Lames actin for the gram they deserve an Oscar (Yes)
Hunnid bucks for a meal got a thankful lobster (Yes)
Punch shit in the mall feeling like a boxer
Was down on my ass stood up and fixed my posture (Ten toes)
Imma monster feel the devil up inside of me if he say shoot I got it on the side of me (boom)
Like it’s construction on the street you can’t ride on me
Thought he was my man’s but that nigga fucking lied on me (Fucking lame)
Used to love to hoop nigga now I love to swipe (I do)
Ju a demon better hide cuz he love to fight
Tough guy on the net I guess he love to type, that’s alright though cause when I see him imma end his night
Locked in like I’m tryna reach for the ropes (huh?)
She a head hunter so I’m reachin for the throat (Come here)
Dog kinda far so I’m reachin for the scope
Watch yo mouth lil bitch you speaking to the goat (Im the goat)

Ain’t no breaks on the road you better pack a lunch (What)
Matter fact dog you better pack a bunch cuz if it work we ain’t coming back for months
BabyTron broke? dog you sound retarded (You do)
Demi god with the pieces they cannot be guarded
Whip hit the dash and I had to push to start it
Better step back from this rocket like you James Harden (brr-boom)
I made about 10 and I ain’t even 18
Last year we went crazy now it’s 2k18
Said that I’m broke you need to wake up out yo day dream Whole crew sticked up we look like the “A Team”
Bust a jugg, yes, yes, feel like Daniel Bryan
All my numbers hit online so they keep buying
Racing to the cash you in last better keep trying
Teachers play my songs at school and I am not lying
Youngest nigga ballin feelin like Emoni Bates
Woulda thought I truck drive I’m doin state to state
In about a year me and dee we gone race the race
Talk on the net just wait until we face to face
God talkin to me man i know my time is coming (it is), and yo dawg was talkin crazy so his time is coming (brr-boom)
Good buffs 30 pointers got a nigga sinus running, come and get me dawg I ain’t got no time for running (I dont)
Shittyboyz on top dog cut the act (Cut it out)
Good steak at Ruth Chris the waiter cut the fat
If I got a play with bro then imma cut the stack
Not D rose but my shooter he buss for his cap (bitch)
How you gon stack if you spend the profit
