[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Cuddy in the wilderness, he set up shop in North Dakota
Forty scored on purple with the seal like, "Point me towards the soda"
TRX fully loaded, this bitch all-terrain (Skrrt)
You on rookie level, boy, we ball on hall of fame
Didn't Juice WRLD tell you these hoes all the same
?
Fuck around and snatch yours 'fore I pawn a chain
Doin' all that starin', fuck around and catch an ass whooping
Lil' bitch got that widebody, I'ma call her Catwoman
Honkin' like a meanie in that 'Ghini, catch me Lamb' pushing
Before the raps, I went and built a lil' stash jugging
Punching numbers in, I told 'em that my card tweaking
Lost lil' brodie out of nowhere, feel my heart shrinking
If you ain't got a plan or no goals, you better start thinking
QP of thatâ€” (Yeah) you would think my arms reeking
Stuck off the Wocky, I'm just chillin' in the dark, dreaming
Catch an opp up at the mall, I bet them members spark Neiman's
Catch him trippin' out in traffic, leave him in a parked Demon
Certified scammer, I'm with Certified Trapper
Pop was brown skin, I doubled up and turned my Sprite blacker
Life like a book, I just turned through five chapters
Me and Dee on Rodeo like, "Who 'vert gon' fly faster?" (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Finna have two freaky hoes eat each other like some beta fish
Pocket full of Benjamins, my granny think I'm banging Crip
Nah, this ain't a fifth (Nope)
Wockhardt, sealed pint, catch me taking sips (Ah)
Slid down, face covered like case dismissed (Brrt)
Gang in love with his switch, he got a grave to dig (Brrt)
Turn them hams to bacon bits if they hang with pigs (Boom)
Playmaker turned coach, feel like Jason Kidd
Nah, for real, tell them boys we got a game to win (Yeah)
Nah, for real, tell them boys we got a game to win (Yeah, brrt, brrt)
