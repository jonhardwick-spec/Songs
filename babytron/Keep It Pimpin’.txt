[Intro]
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bein' down'll make you wanna get up
Sometimes, bein' down'll make you wanna give up
Drank addict, watch my steps, I don't kick cups
Bitch, you ain't special, I'll forget you off a lit blunt
I'll forget you off a deuce and a shroom
Forget what whip I'm in, but it vroom and it zoom
Lookin' in the mirror, boy, just do what you do
From the womb to the tomb, I'ma cruise to the blues
[Verse 2: Lil Blade]
Tryna play with LBR, you gon' cruise to the news
Yeah, Louis to the shoes and my neck full of jewels
How you mad about a bitch that done fucked the whole crew?
Feelin' rose on my toes, I done fucked the whole shoe
Leave some holes in his clothes if a nigga playin' tough
How you think you fuckin' with me on your first pair of buffs?
I bought chains with pocket change, I'm all about my dollars
Had a hundred in the dresser, you can go and ask my mama, nigga
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
When it's beef, yeah, it's up, boy, can't shit squash
Your plug pulled up from the midrange like Chris Bosh
I'm tryna make a 'script pop, you makin' TikToks
Drive it like a NASCAR, only thing, it ain't no pit stops
I'm movin' point-five speed, this my sixth pop
Came straight from out the deep end, that's why I drip, drop
All it take is one to his chest, mister big shot
Must ain't got a brain up in your skull, you think it's shit stopped
