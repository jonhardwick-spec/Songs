[Intro: StanWill]
Yeah, I
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: StanWill]
I got a Glock but I'll beat yo ass
Seen a lot of hate out the opps but ain't seen no cash
Told that lil' bitch, "Toot it up, let me see yo ass"
I might get lost in my drip, I got Nemo splash
Huh, make it splash, feel like Chris Smoove
She ain't got that super soaker on her, made that bitch move
She cannot pronounce the brand, she said I got big shoes
I got yellow and white diamonds, I can mix jewels
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Ksubi jeans skinny, ain't my dick, it's a blicky
Heron Preston now out of Saks, ain't no Dickies
If they sending shots then I'm shooting, take 'em with me
Hitting chip readers like Blake Griffin, banging giffies
Fifteen hunnid get you gone, boy, that's three giffies
If you ain't ShittyBoyz, you can't even fucking breathe with me
Three hunnid dollar plate, kinda make it hard to eat with me
Bro made a hit first day out like he Tee Grizzley
[Verse 3: TrDee]
I don't like sex, really known to get the head then dip
I ain't even ask my mixtape, ain't even have a skip
I ain't even playing, have yo mama yelling, crying, RIP
Pull up in the night, let it sing like we brought the Pips
Huh, y'all ain't even hip
When I get bored or irritated, I'ma take a trip
Huh, that ain't even this
Brought The Undertaker for the niggas think I'm throwing fists
