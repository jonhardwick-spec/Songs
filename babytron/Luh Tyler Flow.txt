[Intro]
Whew, ayy
I had lil' boy money, had to go and grow up
Ayy, she got bomb head on her, but I still won't go and blow her phone up
[Chorus]
Treat the jeweler like a gym, the buffies got me toned up
Said you did it, so what? You gon' have to show us
I ain't lay up with yo' bitch, but I'm equipped with pro touch
Sniper peepin' out they crib, he finna throw the drone up
Shawty got the most to say, but she don't really know much
Played it by the law, I stayed down, now I'm froze up
Know some scammers loadin' up, shooters with they poles tucked
Pop a P, I'm floatin', the drank I'm sippin' potent
Blicky on me pokin', they don't еven notice
Strapped up likе a Trojan, the Addy got me focused
All these bitches bogus, the roll so big, can't fold it
It's a blowout on the score, we leavin' them boys hopeless
[Verse]
Why you rappin' 'bout that foreign whip? You never drove it
Bro up in the store lit, the zotty got me chokin'
I'm the boss, the beat done came to me for some promotion
I'm all in, devoted, in first place, we golden
Her pussy, yeah, I own it, my wrist, you think it's swollen
It's ice chunks, it's ice chunks, it's ice chunks, I'm frozen
Take a hit and hold it, the stress that I'm blowin'
We caught him in the street and left him grilled right on Conan
Free my unky, everyday, I check his OTIS
Yo' bitch be runnin' straight to me, say you controllin'
Stilpane in the soda, spike my Jones
I get some game and soak it, so much of it, we coachin'
Silencer up on the K, I tucked it in my Ksubi jeans
Ho', that's only two, be actin' like you made the movie screen
Titi in the kitchen with a book, her codename Junie B
What I'm rollin' up, it's loud enough to make yo' roomie leave
'Vert, it go skrrt-skrrt
Before the better start, go through the worst first
Always knew I'd be a star since my first verse
They prayin' on my downfall and that the curse works
Put 'em in a church shirt
Chew the yerc', it's chewin' back, used to that, you knew to that
Brodie catchin' plays plus some jacks, let me include the hats
Move the bag, you shoot the bag? Might lose the bag, but who's to blame?
AP skelly cost one-fifty with no diamonds, super plain
She just licked the spirit out me 'fore her Uber came
And I think she boost my IQ, lil' bitch got tutor brain
Glocks, chops, ARPs, and Drac's, you got a Ruger, lame
Doing eighty on the interstate, this why the troopers trained
Tour bus off the shroomies, now that's road trippin'
Shit, I'm feelin' like the young Ye, this bitch gold diggin'
They don't stand on no business, Wocky make my soul glisten
Clothes vintage, I just wish I had some Act' to pour with it
Cuddy ain't even got a permit, catch him on the stove whippin'
Why you in yo' ho' business? Askin' did I hit the bitch, like, is the globe spinnin'?
Freaky ho', she dome givin'
This the Mitten, thousand-dollar coat 'cause it might snow inches
