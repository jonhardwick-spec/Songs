[Verse 1]
Ja-Ja-Ja-Ja-Ja-Jacked up, 256 on the gigabytes
RIP lil' Chris, it make me sick he ain't live his life
ShittyBoyz the shit, we jump shit, you better get it right
Let the Glock uppercut his ass, think I'm finna fight
Three trips, three dubs, damn, that's a three-peat
Hit the interstate and put up stats like the Greek Freak
Jam with this shit, it say approved when it beep-beep
Fendi belt looking like I should've used a cheat sheet
Treat her like a smoothie, put her ass in a blender (Spinner)
Drip causing floods, better go and check the weather
Watch dawg spirit exit soon as he enter
Margielas on, now I'm paint stepping like a center (Margiela)
Even my bitch neck froze, look like Elsa (Woo)
Skipped first hour, now I'm first class in Delta
Been a legend in my city, feeling like I'm Zelda (I have)
BabyTron, I been charged up like a Tesla (Bitch)
Would do the Scat but I wanna do the Wraith instead
Walked out the store with six systems like a gamerhead (Woo)
Save yo bread, I'ma run it up until I break a leg
California king, Versace robe while I lay in bed
Duke said it ain't where you start but where you finish (Facts)
Eating steak now from when it wasn't in the kitchen (Ruth Chris)
Fuck a gift for Christmas, baby, I was born with it
Hustler DNA so if I want it, I'ma get it
I done prayed for some shit that ain't never came trueI done waited for some packages that never came through
Better save up yo Pros, boy, that shit'll save you
If I was you and you was me, shit, I'd probably hate too (Shit)
I ain't finna box but Ju Sleaze got the Golden Gloves (Woo)
I ain't gon' stop until I drop a piece from Golden Sun (Woo)
Feeling like the chosen one, shit, I am the chosen one (Woo)
I don't blow crud but I'll hit the strip and blow a dub (Huh)
