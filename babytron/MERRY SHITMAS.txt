[Verse]
It's the first day of Christmas, what's a true love?
I bought myself new bullets and a new gun
Second day of Christmas, your bitch buggin' for some new UGGs
Third day of Christmas, all I'm askin' for is blue huns
Fourth day of Christmas, why these hoes think I'm Santa?
On the fifth day of Christmas, need a four for my Fanta
On the sixth day of Christmas, I was on the road
Same with the seventh, I just seen a sign that said "Sweet home Alabama"
On the eighth day, I want some Martine Rose pajamas
On the ninth day of Christmas, all I need is a box of loose leaves
Strawberry, I don't roll bananas
If I catch an opp on the tenth day, gon' open-hand 'em
On the eleventh day of Christmas, all cuddy did was sell wеight
I don't fuck with that number, slept through the twеlfth day
On the thirteenth day, it was nonstop action, I made thirteen plays
Can't remember the fourteenth, I smoked fourteen eighths
It's ten days until Christmas on the fifteenth day
At the wester on the sixteenth, blew sixteen K
On the seventeenth, we built a gingerbread house
In here countin' green, crackin' seals, spillin' red out
Merry Christmas
We four away until the big day
On the twenty-second day, I popped out with six chains
On the twenty-third, I built a snowman
Couple Percs and an orange, I ain't use no Xans
All Christmas Eve, we was wrappin' 'bows up
My bitch better have a bow wrapped around a Rolls truck
I ain't got no cookies for him, if he come through the chimney, a switchy
Everyday used to be Christmas, I'm talkin' giffy on giffy
It was a long twenty-five days, it's finally Christmas
Mama bought you somethin' to wear, like, shit, you finally crispy
