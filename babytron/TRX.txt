[Intro]
Hey
[Chorus]
The wagyu I ate fire, you be at PF Chang's
How the fuck I'm flyin'? I ain't made it out of TSA
You gon' still be on games when they drop the PS8
On my way to plaques, a Grammy and a VMA
Moissanite menace, every single one is VS fake
Everything bigger, TRX with the TX plates
[Verse]
We'll turn an intersection to the Grand Prix
Whole gang on bullshit, movin' like a stampede
Somewhere right by the drac', finna shoot it, van fleet
I been spendin' too much pape', I need a hundred band week
Uppin' blues, uppin' dubs, the road turquoise
3D printed, pistol plastic, but it ain't a Nerf toy
Off the shroomies, hear a demon, angel, and a third voice
You the type with twenty seconds left to score your first point
When it come to pain, shit, the drugs was my first choice
He actin' like my oldest son, that's my first boy
Get all my shoppin' out in Birmingham, it's time to search Troy
Think about your bitch every time I hear a slurp noise
Baby Drakey, it go "blrrp," I think it got the runs
You out here tryna have some fun, but you ain't got the funds
I done got the hate, I done got the love
I can't put the locks on her cuffs, I ain't got the trust
They gon' end up underneath us, thinkin' we ain't got the ups
End up hittin' someone else, bitch, every time I rock the Buffs
Go and glue them bitches on 'cause you ain't got the nuts
I can throw these hoes from chill to sport, you know the Crocs adjust
When it comes to cheese, Darren Walsh, bitch, I got the touch
Won't confront the fact I'm in your hoes, boy, you ain't got the guts
You done stuck it in that runner raw and now you got the bumps
Brodie crawlin' all around your crib, but he is
not The Grudge
We'll turn the opposition to some cannabis
First time I had paralysis was off the Actavis
Not no car crash, I made my first ten on accident
If he seen a quarter ticket, it was on an acid trip
Since you got the big head, let me borrow some, boo
In here today and Jacks, finna tomorrow some too
Thank God for another day, prayin' tomorrow comes through
Thank God for another day, prayin' tomorrow comes through
It fuck me up sometimes that I'm really a millionaire
But you can blow that quick, I'm tryna be a trillionaire
Mr. Do-The-Dash, I'm ridin' dirty like Chamillionaire
How this bitch from 7 Mile, but she got Brazilian hair?
Ain't a thing changed, boy, this life shit still ain't fair
Ain't a thing changed, looked up and they still ain't there
How the fuck he have a full plate and he still ain't share?
