[Intro]
Boyz, Dog $hit Militia, long live $cam, you know?
Yo, run it back from the top
(
E-E-Enrgy made this one
)
We gon' do it every time, Enrgy
Hey
[Verse 1]
I'm finna travel 'cross the country with a brick or two
With a switch or two, with a bitch or two
On my way to the lot to drop a whip or two
Cuddy riding with a script, he finna make a flip or two
W-w-w-w-walking in the booth to make a hit or two
Need a Patek, Vacheron, and a Richard, too
Buy a stick, then mod the stock and the trigger, too
I got a few up my sleeve, gon' pull a trick or two
[Chorus]
I been shittin' all my life, they call me Mr.
2
Boy, you Mr. who? Show me a slip or two
Every day's Christmas, wake up, buy me a gift or two
NYC on New Years, I might have to catch a Lyft or two
12.5K, okay
12.5K on the 'fit, might take a flick or two
Habibi playin' noseguard, might take a blitz or two
Hate these hoes, wak–µ up tryna take a dick or two
