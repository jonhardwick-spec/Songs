[Chorus: Certified Trapper]
I just upped the score for the fourth time
Pull a cookie out, got it looking like an organ
Popped a nigga up, nigga, it was 'round four or five
I can shoot the chop, both hands, bitch, I'm orthodox
Baby tryna pull up two thirties, we can shoot a movie
Shit, fuck, Damjonboi made this beat groovy
Bitch, I'm off the E's, I don't know, 'cause you niggas fluky
Get up on that tip and blow, this a fucking Uzi
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Shout out to my shooter, I can't say his name, he beat a Boosie
I can send a blitz on you from Tokyo while eating sushi
I just left a lil' bitch on a stretcher, you ain't seen her boobies
You done let that freak bitch have her way, you pulled up eatin' booty
Should I play the ARP or should I play the baby Drac'?
Trapper said his pager would'vе slapped way back in eighty-eight
Boy, cut it out, only thing fuckеd up is my sleep schedule
Only time doggy around some cheese is when he eat pretzels
[Verse 2: Certified Trapper]
Bust down 'Woods, I got my paper up
If you ain't with the Hutch, your shit fake as fuck
If you ain't get your shit from Johnny, I don't give no fucks
Demon shit, I got the Glock on my body, I mean body on my Glock
That's your favorite capper
That nigga broke as fuck, that's your favorite rapper
Eight G's on me right now, I could buy a chopper
Shoot your whole fuckin' car up, go and buy an Acura
I'm a real street nigga, not a fuckin' actor
