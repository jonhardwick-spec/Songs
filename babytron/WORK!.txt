[Intro]
Phew, ayy

It's Hokatiwi

[Verse 1]
Grindin' like I'm Rob Dyrdek, this shit ridiculous
When you play that back door, you cannot be conspicuous
Only time I match with the drip, 'fit intricate
Typin' numbers in, card green like an immigrant
It was fraudulent, but now the pape' legitimate
Prince of the Mitten, they'll tell you that in Michigan
If they try denyin' it, they probably been a bitch
Treat that drop like a comment when we pinnin' it
Choked off a puff, thnk the 'za laced with cinnamon
Shit, the way I'm gettin' chased, you'd probably think I'm in the mix
The move that I hit her with meant for finishin'
Told him, "Say no to drugs," blowed, I'm a hypocrite
Soon as he walkеd away, I sat back and sipped a six
Cuddy got one eyе open while he hit the scripts
You would think we need a wheelbarrow how we flippin' bricks
Brodie said he put the Percs down, but he miss the itch
On the road jacked up like I gotta fix the whip
Dog Shit Militia, play with us, you get bit by pits
Treat the buffs like the TRX, had to tint my sticks
I was fallin' off that cliff, had to fix my grip
Never, ever, ever could I slip, had to blick my hip
Boy, I'm rich as shit
What that mean? That mean think 'fore you fix your lips
Bean talk with the plug, did the pintos ship?
If I ain't top one on it, then forget your list, Bible
Jack of all trades, I'm a human Swiss army knife
I might stand up on the table, leave the party hype
Nah, I'm playin', you won't catch me out, I ain't the party type
Clip curlin' off the Drac', lookin' like an Arby's fry
Lookin' like a hairball in the 'Cat, I live the Marni life
I got fire on my waist, but the Cartis ice
(Long live $cams, SBDSM, alright, look)
Life a gamble, brodie catchin' jacks, I had to follow suit
Watch your surroundings, shooter trailin', tryna follow you
When you got a couple dollars, hoes, they'll swallow you
Got unc' scammin', his ID say Bartholomew
