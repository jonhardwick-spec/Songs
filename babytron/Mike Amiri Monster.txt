[Part I]
[Intro]
E-Enrgy made this one
Brr
Ha, ha, ha
[Verse]
I know you hear my jeans growlin', I'm aâ€”
Yeah, I know you hear my jeans growlin', I'm a Mike Amiri monster
Got it out the mud, the pape so dirty, gotta money launder
Bitch was always good for crackin' jokes, I'm actin' funny on her
Swervin' in a 'vert with Lil Uzi, bitch, my money longer
Pour a Quagen in the glass VOSS, this some muddy water
Boy, fuck that baby Draco, Akhi got a rocket launcher
I could put the whip in space mode, shit, I got a saucer
Spent seven-fifty on Palm Angels, I just copped the joggers
Heard its money out, time to restock embossers
Flyin' in the foreign, shootin' lasers like a fighter pilot
Christian Loubie, red bottoms drippin' like a fire hydrant
We gon' pull up splashin' with them ladders like we fire fightin'
2017, you probably seen me up in Meijers, swipin'
Pop dirtier than swamp water, this bitch mutated
Lifestyle four-K, it's lookin' like you Blu-Rayin'
Fill the Game Breaker, take a shot, I bet the hoop breakin'
I can get a thousand pills and ten pints off two patients
Shit, I was too patient
Bet not open that oven, dog food bakin'
Alpharma and the Act', sick, my juice ancient
Every step I take exquisite, I can't move basic
Twin drums, give his ass two-hundred like a Chug Jug
That's my la familia, I gotta show the plug love (Brr)
It's time to grow up and stop reminiscin' on that one run
Used to look up at the stars, ain't know I would become one (Brr, ha, ha)
Shit, the more you work (Brr), the more it pays off
In that low-rider, catch a body, than I scrape off (Skrrt)
