[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'm the source, lil' bitch, I supply the plug
New crib so I punched a designer rug
High as hell, Yao Ming off designer drugs
No cap, more chops than the biker club
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Got a sweet tooth for the scams
Watch yo lil' bitch, I got a lil' thing for hitting fans
Dukes mad at me, I spent her rent on my pants
I don't sell, lil' bitch, call Stan
[Verse 3: StanWill]
201 Lord, I'm a Visa thief
Good SSN, that's easy cheese
Singing to the pape' like B.B. King
Punch like Pacquiao, I ain't seen a ring
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Yo bitch sitting on my wood, she a bench warmer
Easy day, Punch God, this my tenth quarter
Couldn't put up these stats in like ten quarters
Fake ID, doing fraud, bitch, I'm Ben Port–µr
