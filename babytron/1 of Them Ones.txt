[Intro]
Pullin' up, kids like, "Mama, it’s a Wraith, look"
These hoes really livin' for some likes on Facebook
You the type to up it just to get your K took
Five-eleven, with the blicky, I feel eight foot
When they pull us out the car, I shouldn't have to say, "Shush"
Get up out the way or you get straight mushed
A thousand watts in the zapper, get your brain cooked
With the slimers, fuck around and get your chain took
Huh, fuck around and get your rank took
Ain’t no keys up in the whip, bitch, I done came push
Wanna join the team? Then show me how your game look
He done missed every shot, doggy came rook'
Same me still hangin' with the same crooks
Puttin' cuffs on these sluts, they tryna play hook'
Schedule busy than a fuck, like, let's see how the day looks
[Verse]
Up that pole and make him strip, no homo
Shit, I'm workin' on myself right now, I can’t do no promo
I’m in a rush, sorry, I can't do no photos
It takes a team to win, you can’t be solo-dolo
I just wanna take a deuce and pour it, you know it
You can't really fake it, it's gon' show if you focus
Told lil’ bro if he miss the load, he demoted
It's on the floor if he catch it, he gon' get promoted
I put my all into this shit, I been devoted
If my double cup fallin', I'ma get heroic
Only motion, it's time to go forget emotions
I ain't just sayin' shit, I think I'm really chosen
Hit his top for triple, hell nah, this is not a dilly bonus
Why you playin' with your life? You know we switchy totin'Ain't no duckin', ain't no runnin' when that glitchy blowin'And we over-doin' shit, it got a Mickey on it
I can make a stack in a minute, sixty moments
Bitch, ain't hip to BabyTron, she thought she seen a hippy blowin'
Fire bombed his spot, shit, no, that ain't the chimney smokin'
Even all my hoes from high school knowin' that Jimmy goated
ShittyBoyz, yeah, they probably pissed that we been goin' up
Pinpoint the bag and send the lo', I bet I'm showin' up
Shrooms, juice, three yerkies, OMG, I'm throwin' up
Take your wood and unravel it, pussy, you ain't roll enough
Take your dirty Sprite and throw it out 'cause you ain't pour enough
You the type to up the roll on the 'Gram while O and up
You might get killed for that
Tryna get up where I'm at, you gon' need stilts for that
I heard what you did, you know you ill for that
Cutty servin' oranges, play with him and you get peeled for that
All the pain, I got pills for that
Tryna be the king? You gon' have to climb the hill for that
They thought they broke me down, but shit, I'm still intact
Playin' with the gang? Gon' need a will for that
Dog Shit Militia, how ironic, I just killed her cat
Tryna keep up with the team, you ain't got skills for that
I heard it's war, I got bills for that
Nah, for real, a hundred on me, got a Wilt for that
Tuh, all that cap, you got milk with that?
Ghost Glocky, 3D printed, we just buildin' straps
Doggy died off a chest shot, is that still a hat?
Swingin' 'round in the jungle where the 'rillas at
Put him in a grave for that shit, I wasn't diggin' that
Time is money, truth is, you cannot get a minute back
Yeezy collab if I'm in some Gap
Ain't no way you make it through the function, boy, I'm in the back
They like, what he in? In the Scat'? In the Cat'?
In the Track'? In the TRX, shit, in the Lamb'?
I done gave a lot of shit out, but I won't give a damn
Twenty hours on that road, both calves getting cramped
Sent her in the store with punches, all I said was "Get 'em, champ"
Treat the brick like an envelope, this fucker gettin' stamped
We in the kitchen, go and get some pans
It's too much work in here, can I please get a hand?
Ain't no sunbooths in here, but the— gettin' tan
Find a lane, find a run, then that bitch gettin' spammed
Ain't shit changed, boy, I'm still gettin' bands
Bitch, you better eat the whole dick if you get the chance
Goin' with the flow, the victories ain't gettin' planned
We sell QPs and up, hell nah, you can't get a gram
I was doin' all the hammin', you was probably gettin' scammed
You was blowin' up her phone, she was in here gettin' rammed
One, two, three, ding, ding, ding, gettin' slammed
Bitches tryna get a ring, out here tryna get a ham
I'm a fuckin' king, you a peasant at the best
I can hear him wheezing, gangnem steppin' on they neck
Shit, you ain't even got to question if we blessed
I think doggy bone twelve, got more questions than a test
