Bitch, let me see that shit you doin' all on TikTok

Lil' brodie, he a demon, killin' shit right in his flip-flops
Let off sixty, just a pitstop
She see me on and off the road, she wanna dickride
Pocket full of blue faces like I'm Chrisean
Pour out some syrup for the guys, I swear I miss mine
Put a bitch on the curb, I'ma serve, I'ma swerve
Man, I gotta move this work, yeah, I trap the first to third
Hit a bitch from the 'burbs 'cause her daddy got the birds
Fuck with mines, we gon' purge, we gon' put you on a shirt
Grab a pop, I got drop, it don't stop
