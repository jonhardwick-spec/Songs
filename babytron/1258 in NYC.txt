Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
That's on God that we next to blow
BIN God, this a six you will never know
Most hated where I'm from, it's whatever though
Knockout chop, the K'll turn him to the letter OHa-ha, that means I'll put a hole in him
Call the bitch "Andrew", this little ho wigging
Balling overtime, I used to get no minutes
Caught him drinking lemonade and shot him, Cole Bennett
[Verse 2: TrDee]
It's so sick we talk wet on these samples
She sent me a booty pic and ask can I handle
Not playing with these niggas like I got a broke ankle
Without Steve I would've been broke, I'm so thankful
Boy, you should stop staring if you don't wanna die
See my mans, he wanna fuck, girl, he just really shy
Hit you with the K like I'm mad and I'm really dry
When I'm talking chopsticks, no, I'm not eating Thai
[Verse 3: StanWill]
I don't serve Google Chrome, bitch is Swiper, fox
Gamebreaker chop, when it shoot, boy, it fires shots
When I leave the store, that's when the fire stop
'Cause the card heat, it don't matter if I slide or not
I can teach you how to punch, kung fu master
Tried to trap with the double team, now it's two Caspers
Me and bro both slam so we two slashers
Got the opps hating from behind, told 'em move faster
