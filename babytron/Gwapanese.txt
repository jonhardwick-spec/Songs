[Intro: Nate Husser]
This shit different
Yeah
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Nate Husser]
Yeah, care about the planet, so I grow a lot of trees
I travel 'round the world, I had to learn to speak Gwapanese
She fuckin' with me, she gotta be into astronomy
Put that on my mother, ain't no motherfucker stoppin' me
[Chorus: Nate Husser]
Just stop it, just stop it
Just stop it, just stop it
Just stop it, just stop it
Just stop it (Go), just stop it (Go)
Just stop it (Go), just stop it (Go)
Just stop it (Go), just stop it (Go)
Just stop it (Go), just stop it (Go)
Just stop it (Go)
[Verse 1: Nate Husser]
Just stop it, I can't stop it
Can't help it, the guap, I'm on top it
They hatin' and they talkin'
I'm trendin', a topic
Can't blame him, he poppin' shit
Not famous, just rockin'
Them Benzs, they topless, the pendant
It's the block, we the business
Sky rocket, yeah
Blast off, Team Rockеt
That monster all in my pocket
I'm a mobster, this in my DNA
And shе gon' take the squad, she like gettin' nasty, she want the D in the A
I left the hood, I be in L.A
I'm more on the ground, but my wrist in a lake
And my head in the clouds, my bitch in a Wraith
The other day, I was doin' the race
I'm doin' it right, I was doin' it crazy
I'm doin' it late and I'm doin' it early
I said I'ma do it, I do it for certain
I said I'ma do it, I do it with purpose
I do it with verb, I'm swaggin', I'm surfin', and nobody perfect
I'm lit on the surface, I'm lit on the Indo
I open the curtain, you can't see what's in it (Uh-uh)
Yeah, the windows is tinted
I'm ridin' with winners, I'm slidin' with sinners (Oh)
