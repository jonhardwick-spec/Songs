Getta Beats
Skinny guy but when I got the blick, I'm Debo
(Ayy)
Skinny guy but when I got the blick, I'm Debo (Ayy)
How the fuck I'm a buck twenty and feel like Debo? (Ayy)
Huh, bitch, I'm Debo
Skinny guy but when I got the blick, I'm Debo
Bitch, I'm Debo
Skinny guy but when I got the blick, I'm Debo (Ayy, ShittyBoyz)
[Verse]
That's what I say when the chip slam
Star player now, I used to be the sixth man
Put a bag on yo head and call my hitman
Getting head on the lodge, had to switch hands
Huh, paint stepping like a big man
Undefeated with this punch, feel like Ip Man
Human Made t-shirt but I'm the Tin Man
Huh, big hands, jugging spree, this my fifth scam
If I'm the sixth man then I'm Lou Will
And if we catch two opps then that's two kills
Skrrting on the turnpike, I'm on two wheels
Better step, bro like Hulk off them two pills
Speak up, bitch, I'm in the Appalachian Mountains
If dude ask for the sauce, smack the Plankton out him
I'ma give dude wings, slap a halo on him
Bro did the Macarena on him
I'ma do my dance when the Visa pop
Red and blue beams, thought that he seen the cops
You was a good-ass kid, you a demon now?
Hit the site for a punch, I'm Vegeta now
Nine thousand in my 'Miris, feel like Goku
Told myself I'm the GOAT, that shit so true
Them baggy-ass jeans, boy, it ain't '02
I'm a pro with the fraud, switched to Pro Tools
Jay Ale's mashed potatoes, told him hold the butter
I know you sick yo bitch fucking on a Jonas Brother
And if it's up then it's stuck, I'll throw him under
Steven Adams type shit, bitch, I'm blowing thunder
Oh, you gon' kill me? Huh, okey-doke
Hit the self-scam fooling, did the Hokey Pokey
Long-ass tongue, this lil' ho like Yoshi
Turn his chest to a donut, holy moly
Off-White 1s, Virgil did his thang on it
If she a freak, Zion, I'ma bang on her
Nah, for real, grab her rim and I hang on her
Talking 'bout a bag?
You in yo closet, Frank Ocean
Looking in my closet, thought I need a passport
It's all bad if I memorize that last four
Took my shoes off and slid through the backdoor
This hammer on me end games, you can ask Thor
Taught my bitch how to scam, she's a jack whore
Hating on my life? I'd be pissed if I had yours
I heard yo mama in yo ear, do them damn chores
Why would I cuff a bitch if I could crack yours?
Huh, you gotta toss her, stupid
Slide around with that stick like a Boston Bruin
You'll slip in this drip, don't walk into it
Almost cut into this bitch 'cause she paused my music
Huh, did my dance to that "Beast Mode"And I just made a twenty ball banging "Cheat Code"
T-shirt a three but the drawers a free throw
Skinny guy but when I got the blick, I'm Debo
