[Intro: BabyTron]
Hold on
Whole gang newest BAPE, that's a bunch of sharks
Seen the finish line from the start
Reuel, stop playing with these niggas
It's the newest sharks, yeah
Ayy
It's Lando, yo bitch know, don't let yo bitch go, nigga
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Ha-ha-ha-ha, I think I'm finna punch a car
Whole gang newest BAPE, that's a bunch of sharks
Ain't gon' lie, seen the finish line from the start
Bitch could be a chest surgeon, couldn't touch my heart
Granny saying I'm weird 'cause I got a scam fetish
Shooting jacks down to ATL, Cam Reddish
Human Torch with these got my hands sweating
Shaq with these 201s, bitch, I'm a jam legend
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Bounce him up to the Lord, this a pogo stick
Was down and came up, on some yo-yo shit
If that bitch ain't pulling phones, she can't get no more dick
Shooter throwing touchdowns, on some Tony Romo shit
Come on, bitch, you ain't Cinderella
Got that stick at all times, I ain't lacking ever
Reaching over here? Better use your cerebellum
Or bro'll up chop and turn into a pair of 'Gielas
