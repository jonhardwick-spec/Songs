[Part I]
[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Bye Kyle
)
Brr
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Thinkin' he nuts?
AR do the vasectomy
(Brr, bah, boom, bah)
Baccarat, Creed, but I still smell the jealousy
Hundred percent, you be giving it seventy
Uppin' my weaponry, searching for enemies (Ayo, Cordae, where they at?)
You can hear the Redeye rumble like it's Anthony Johnson
Spent five at Saks, I was casually shoppin' (Shit, shit)
Got a sweet tooth for pape', goddamn, think my cavities rotten
(Shit)
Fly as hell, ain't no gravity options
Outer space, in the galaxy watchin'
If you down, make a strategy, plot it
I don't do the Tris, shit, I'm happily Wockin'
[Interlude: Babytron]
(Try to ride this wave and get drowned, Category 5)
(Try to ride this wave and get drowned, Category 5)
[Verse 2: Cordae]
Yeah, ayy, try and ride this wave, no category
Keep the Glock 19, no statutory
(Woo)
Call me "Dexter," how I stay in the laboratory
Shit, I'd rather get high, watch Rick and Morty
What the gang and the trap, that's negatory
My dick harder than a test, bitch, take it for me
And I really got the juice, get naked for me
And if I can't make you cum, you better fake it for meNever mind, end of story
I was just talking to my nigga
He be hangin' with gorillas in the middle of the winter like Tarzan
Now, I be chilling in the villa with some bitches havin' thriller
'Cause I'm known to spit the fire like Charmander
How I buy a new Ferrari if a Carvana
Just bought a new crib out in Tarzana
I'm the shit, I'm that nigga, I'm the commander
I'm the shit, lil' nigga, no propaganda
