(Rado, Rado, Rado, Rado)
Bitch
[Verse]
Picking steak out my teeth, I'm at STK
I'ma go fed if I really talk them SBAs
Team full of ballers, every day them boys text me plays
Steer with my right out the window, it's a lefty day
I'll turn the hard in, unky cook it up
ShittyBoyz, it's a big bag, you think 'bout booking us
How is you the plug? Never took the cord and hooked it up
Pretty lil' classy bitch, I won't even look at sluts
Net worth ain't accurate, won't even look it up
He in the 'Cat, nine lives, ten shots shook him up
MC Scammer, had some BINs that they couldn't touch
Told him I'll do this shit, I'm thinking like, I wouldn't what?
Really all I knew before the rap was jugg and punch
Mе and Stan OT, MacBook full of dumps
Windmill and back for the times when I couldn't dunk
On thе phone like, I gotta go, I'm finna pull in Hutch
Triangle, square, circle, L1, cheat coding
Touchdown, Marshawn Lynch, bitch, I'm beast moding
Stop playing, bitch, I'm like Curry when the three open
Think the reason that I'm working magic 'cause I drink potion
ShittyBoyz, shit talking, this is what I do
Real playmaker, same gang, get a couple oops
Walk you to the water, what you do? That shit up to you
Blue, pink, green, rainbow, what I'm thumbing through
Hot as hell out, droptop, I ain't coming roof
Oldhead talking out his neck, get yo uncle blew
Club deep as hell, Track .2s, I might stumble through
Talk shit and we'll back it up, we the Plunger Crew
Slide vet, I'll teach you magic like I'm Dumbledore
"BabyTron__" on the 'Gram, don't forget the underscores
Backwoods only, what the fuck you roll a funnel for?
If I throw a hundred in the club, could throw a hundred more
Hmm, don't make me go and do it
You twenty-three with gray hairs? You must be going through it
Why you bragging 'bout lil' shit when you 'posed to do it?
Would've thought it's aimbots around, we be so focused shooting
350, 700, shit, I'm just Yeezy stepping
Fireman, every line a punch, I'm just Weezy F-ing
Chess player, twenty moves ahead, I'ma keep 'em guessing
Backdoored yo mans, oh, bitch, you like sneaky seconds
Huh, foreign bitch with the fleaky nails
I ain't leaving home till that one truck bring me mail
Forty deep, twenty dirty sticks, half CPLs
On my way to the top, won't let them see me fail
I could, I could, I could, damn, the Runtz got me stuttering
Fuck tryna make it rain, I'ma have it thundering
Check run, made a easy fifty out of Huntington
Palm Angels cheetah sweat suit, what I'm running in
