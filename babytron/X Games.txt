[Intro: StanWill]
ShittyBoyz this, ShittyBoyz that (Hoes like the X Games)
Stunting on these hoes like the X Games
Stunting on these hoes like the X Games (It's a whole lotta talk, whole lotta cap)
Huh, huh, ayy, yeah
Stunting on these hoes like the X Games (ShittyBoyz this, ShittyBoyz that)
It's our year, it's our decade (
Hokatiwi

ShittyBoyz this, ShittyBoyz that (Stunting on these hoes like the X Games)
Bitch
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Too much, what I paid for this
Tryna punch with my BIN? You gon' break yo wrist
Boy, I'm really plugged in, on some LEGO shit
Threw the monkey nuts in the chop, going ape on shit
You bust yo first jugg? Congratulations
They could be on life support, I'll scam a patient
Big black chop look like a fat Jamaican
Feel like Ndamukong Suh off the sack I'm chasing
Duck, Ducking hoes in my Goose 'cause my heart cold
I was born with different DNA, bitch, I'm part GOAT
Big pape' on me, I'm a walking Wells Fargo
Really plugged in, nigga, I'll get my spark on
Got these hoes on go like the Teen Titans
If I blow the thunder gun, he gon' see lightning
If I punch dawg with this BIN, I could beat Tyson
Brought a slide in and I left with nineteen items
