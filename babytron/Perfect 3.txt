[Intro: BabyTron]
Brrt, brrt
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
Trifecta, that's a perfect three (ShittyBoyz, ShittyBoyz, ShittyBoyz)
Trifecta, that's a perfect three
Frozone in this kit, I walk into Surface free
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Think he on the run, he just a hamster on a wheel
IP got me out of bounds, the feds gon' track it to Brazil
Redeye like a mountain lion, take the 'Cat up through the hills
Reminiscin' 'bout lil' Mari, 40, crack another seal
Pourin' purple, pourin' red, I feel like Bosh with the dreads
Time tickin', work the clock, ain't gon' stop 'til I'm dead
Me and Prince
oinkin' up
, but we are not with the feds
You can try and usе your feet, but I got chop with the legs (Brrt)
Trifecta, that's a pеrfect three (ShittyBoyz, ShittyBoyz, ShittyBoyz)
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Trifecta, that's a perfect three
What you makin' annually the same shit I earn a week
You ain't turnt as we (Nah), tuh, we undeniably the best
Knock the wrinkles out his tee, I put the iron to his chest
Think my dog done grew some wings how he be flyin' in the 'Vette (Skrrt, skrrt)
How I see it, you off sides if you playin' in the middle
Boy, this shit get technical, you know we playin' through the whistle (Brrt)
Only run around with pits, you and your mans look like kibble
Funny how I caught him dolo, shot his friends when I hit him (Hit his Vlone)
Trifecta, that's a perfect three (Dog Shit Militia, bitch, we on that shit forever)
