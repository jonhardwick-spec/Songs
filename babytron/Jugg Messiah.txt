[Intro]
(
Ayy, J.K
)
Man, I'm back again, doing that light shit as usual
You can't fuck with me, man
ShittyBoyz lieutenant, it's BabyTron
Man, you know how that shit go
Huh,
ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
Steak hibachi and my rice sticking to the plate
Foreign Dracs, you can get lifted wit the K
Drip drop, man, I feel gifted in the bay
I'm probably OT, somewhere tripping in the bank
I don't play by the rules like I'm Zaza
Got them babies on me, ain't no fucking goo-goo ga-ga
Bitch, I want a Masi, give a fuck about a Mazda
Pieces at the mall, I done fucked up the plaza
What you know 'bout them dumps with the pin?
You fucking with a rat, she got bumps on her chin
At Jay Ale's, eating lunch with my kin
You couldn't punch a piece, you tryna punch with that BIN
I used to ask niggas if they could plug me in
I'm balling now, used to ask coach to sub me in
Big B's stomping on the mat, I'm coming in
That
number
hit for zero, nigga, that's a Drummond BIN
Walk around with more BINs than yo favorite vendor
Punch God, bitch, you would've thought I had a temper
Whole team powered up, something like Avengers
ShittyBoyz in yo bio? You are not a member
Four for four with this piece, I just punched some Fendi
Four for four when you eat? I'd rather grab Beni's
Told my bitch that's her ass if she act friendly
Yo pieces not hitting, your order still pending
Scam Man, I'll get yo granny bamboozled
Phone Man, bitch, I'm just waiting on approval
Let me get the buffs and ice 'em up like a Toaster Strudel
This chopstick'll turn your mans to a noodle
On the block with this .40 like I'm Laimbeer
I ain't saying that I'm rich but I'm damn near
You won't catch with a gram, only scams here
You fucking with a boss, baby, ain't no ham here
Lay up with you? I’m not Jelly Fam
Stepping in the Air Forces, do the Nelly dance
Bet yo bitch will blow my socks off if she got the chance
Louis belt and this motherfucker came from France
Good piece hit for higher than yo Snap score
You was just acting tough, what you moving back for?
Bitch got a nigga so I slide through the backdoor
Big gun, bitch, we strapped like the task force
This choppa'll make his body twitch, what up, isojeff?
Big B's cost seven, that's how I like to step
One on one, God, bitch, I swear that I swipe the best
Dee got the hands, man, I swear he got the Tyson left
Upping rolls on yo nigga, you can ask the 'Gram
Jugging on the 'Gram, baby, go and ask the hams
On the road so much I'm bound to hit a traffic jam
Told my mama I like fast money so I have to scam
Oh, you shoot now? Take yo hooping-ass back in that gym
Got the blues now? Take yo boosting-ass back in that crib
Guess she choose now, seen the roll, now I'm back in her ribs
Cameras on the Beam' when Stan back up in the whip
Demons on my ass, I'm tryna find a way to lose 'em
Fucking dummy head, we got the straps so we can use 'em
Got a stack to punch, let's hit the store and go abuse 'em
Hoes used to ho me, now I get to pick and choose 'em
I'm sick the opps facing Blacks tryna get off
On my rap snow cap
, I been took the lid off
Bitch said some [?] shit so I slid off
Touch a hair on me and my dawg'll knock yo shit off
BabyTron, I got more punches than a dojo
Win on my own, with no squad like a solo
Tryna take me out the game? Nigga, that's a no no
'Cause my shooter ain't missing like he train with [?]
Got a lil' bitch scorching off the face card
Fuck yo dead mans, keep that nigga in the graveyard
We was in them hoes' guts, crazy how they hate ours
Shout-out to, I ran it up off of eight cards
I would put you on but you don't know the code
Fuck the finish line, it's twelve hundred on my toes
Thought the judges sent me home when I hit the road
'Cause I punched three X's in the Apple store
