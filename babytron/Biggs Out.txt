[Intro: G.T.]
(
Ooh, Sav killed it
)
Ayy, yeah, come on (I just walked in too, nigga)
It's G.T., nigga (This shit off the dome, nigga)
Ayy, nigga, what up? (Let’s get this shit in, nigga)
Ayy, nigga (Biggs home, nigga, let's go)
Ayy
[Verse 1: G.T.]
I heard they let Biggs out (For real? What?)
Call Rose, bring the Benz out (Come on, Rose, nigga, let's go)
Whip so fast, tap it and it spin out
I remember they was young as hell, nigga, whippin’ ten out
True Religion, thick session, nigga, at your bitch house (For real)
Ask Whites, nigga, me gettin' it in (For real, nigga)
Floatin' caps on the Forgis, when I stop, they spin (Yeah)
Next week probably in Miami in a drophead
I ain't even got no beef, all the opps dead
C8 come through all black, but the guts red (Skrrt)
Bro, I only call your bitch when I want head (For real)
And if you ever think we sweet, you gon' catch lead
Could've jumped in the 'Cat, but I took the Benz (For real)
Buffs cost four flat, that's without the lens
Y’all niggas bunch of followers and we set the trend
[Verse 2: The Godfather]
On the East, I just caught a play, where the fuck is G.T.? (Where you at?)
Spin your block like a record or a CD
Comin’ back to back like that Drake song, but I ain't sign nothing (Come on now)
Chopstick, flip the clip, tryna rewind something (Yeah)
Ice on, stomp your head in, I catch you eyein’ something (What?)
Chase you down on the freeway, we on the Lodge bussin'
Ham called me tryna buy a pint, I sold him Robitussin (Ham)
We got a problem, ain't no talkin', it ain’t no discussion
