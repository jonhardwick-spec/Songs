[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Fuck a hoop run, catch me running in the bank
You rather get yo shit beat, running in the paint
Bro a Wockstar, catch him running to the drank
If there's money on the floor then I'm running like I'm late
Flash and the grip on the stick, this ain't Black Ops
Double mashed potatoes with the steak, I'm at Black Rock
Fraud God, feeling like a wizard on that laptop
Her credit score 800, I hit the jackpot
[Verse 2: Kash Giovanni]
Best Buy green with the slides, nigga, thank God
Punched all the J's that dropped 'cause I hate lines
Sleeping overnight, I ain't even finna waste time
Sprint on the phone, fake playing me eight lines
What the fuck? I done lift like I can't drive
Should I punch everything like I hate slides?
In Walmart, hood on like I'm Trayvon
Good money order, five minutes I done made five
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
On the road dodging 12 like it's GTA
Was in school thrusted like fuck a GPA
Scamming ain't right, but it's the easy way
I ain't tryna thrust, it's just the joggy off the Yeezys day
