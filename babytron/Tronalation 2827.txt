[Verse]
I done seen somebody with a pole gеt it took (For real)
I done seen somebody save a ho then she got fucked
2020, boy, I seen so many Pros gettin' pushed
I done seen somebody really tryna grow then give it up
I know a oldhead who still hustle like he twenty-somethin'
I know a young bull who fifteen, can show you twenty-somethin'
I know the family that support me and I know the funny cousins
I know if Akhi and Habibi ain't around then cuddy comin'
I know scammers, I know killers, I know robbers too (Yeah)
I know some scammers with some CPNs, they droppin' coupes (Yeah)
I know a killer, for ten dollars, he'll pop at you (Yeah)
I know a robber that's gon' aim it but he not gon' shoot (Yeah)
I know a lot of motherfuckers livin' backwards (Yeah)
I know my fam' and my bitch gettin' pampered
I know if it's a question then, shit, it's an answer
I know they stuck on that page but this a different chapter, for real though (Yeah)
I know some hoes from high school and they still hoes (Yeah)
Dawg was broke in high school, funds still low (Yeah)
I know the milli's in the bag, I pray the bill's close
I know a motherfucker taking risks, won't kick a field goal (Yeah)
I know this shit a process, I know you gotta trust me
Yeah, I know this kid a hundred but I know they not gon' touch me
Just know if they be lyin' 'bout the little shit, they not a hundred
Just know if yo' bitch seen the spaceship then she got abducted
