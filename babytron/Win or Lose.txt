[Intro: StanWill]
Yeah
[Verse 1: StanWill]
In this shit called life, you either win or you lose
Since 2017, was turning BINs into blues (
Ayy, Melly, what the fuck is that?
)
Claim they gang when you up but they ain't kin when you lose
Got a arm on my feet, I spent a limb on my shoes
Nowadays it's Mike Amiris but back then it was Trues
Wake up thinking 'bout a bag, dream of M's when I snooze
Brodie Wock' pouring, bitch, I'm Glock toting
Skinny than a bitch, I'm flexing like The Rock on 'em
They say time is money so I guess yo' clock broken
This ARP an SBR, I got a stock on it
I can't even think, BabyTron za' potent
Foam Runners on my feet, bitches think it's Crocs on me
Looking like you run in place, what you got is not motion
Thought my pockеts lost a fight, all these fucking knots poking
In that bag, bitch, we jumping off thе turnbuckle
Could be za' or the opps, gang gon' burn something
Trackhawks and Hellcats, we gon' swerve something
Take the Glock and burn his top, we'll perm something
Better learn something
[Chorus: BabyTron,
TrDee

RPs and V cuts
Bitch, I'm zooted, made a ten off of three dumps
Remember I was broke eating free lunchNow I'm really balling, I won't freeze up
Fuck whoever get the bucket if yo' team up
Had to throw some Creed on to cover up the Pink RuntzIf it's on the floor, pull up with mops, we tryna sweep something
If it's on the floor, pull up with blowers, tryna leave something (If it's on the floor, pull up with shh)
