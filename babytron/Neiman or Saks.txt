ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, long live $cam, dumbass, you know?
Live from the Lab, what up, Gramz?
Ayy, huh (
313 Mafia

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
If I catch you in that Goose coat, it ain't no flockin'
Riding with the sniper gang, I feel like Yak
You ain't had the Stilpane, it feel like Act'
Bro off two 30s wonderin' why he feel like that
Shit, it's all-out war, I'm with the mafia
The shrooms really don't mix good with insomnia
F-f-f-f-f-f-fully, fully switchy fuck your body up
Heard they want some beef, we turned they spot to a hibachi truck
You a grown-ass man with lil'-boy pape'
This the baby version, totin' lil'-boy Drac'
Dipped into the whippits, you might hear a lil' voice change
Told my shooter that I'm payin' triple if it's point blank
[Verse 2: YSR Gramz]
Yeah, Tron, give me 20K, I shoot 'em close range
I ain't gon' lie, I bought a chop before I bought chain
The way my shooter shoot that bitch, he hall of fame
I'm tryna run it up and be on the floor at a Pistons game
Bro said he drunk so much drank, he don't piss the same
Moissanite diamonds in your shit, it don't hit the same
I'm finna drop a big-ass chain like I'm T-Pain
Niggas out here doin' anything for some free fame
A hundred-some shots in this bitch, I'll make it rain
With gang at the BET Awards takin' nigga chains
Put the switchy on his head, aim at his brain
This a Draco in my pants, I don't need a cane
