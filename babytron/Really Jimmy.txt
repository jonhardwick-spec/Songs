(
Enrgy made this one

Turn that bitch back up
Let that bitch wham out
Hey, ran it up so— man
[Verse]
Ran it up so fast, I almost broke the sound barrier
All them excuses, like, you couldn't sound scarier
Where's Humane Society? We beatin' down terriers
Throw me on the beat, boy, I'm beatin' down every verse
Brody said he need a ring for the P's, he married Percs
My heart thirty-two degrees, February 1st
Your very best not a tenth of my very worst
Smokin' unreleased zotti, this some Cherry Nerdz (Cherry Nerdz)
A eighth hit for sixty, unless you buy a QP, then them bitches fifty
Five hundred blues, that's a pretty fifty
Add a hundred more to it, that's a Nipsey sixty
I was listenin' to Guwop, not no Pretty Ricky
This shit 50/50, like, "Is they really with me?"
Know I'm on some bullshit, I hear that voice, like, "Really, Jimmy?" (Really, Jimmy?)
I got it on me, but it's really in me
Two Percs, a fifth, and some 'shrooms, this lil' bitty litty
When SBDSM touch, it's a shitty city
Moncler in PA, you gotta know that Philly chilly
Wonderin' what's up in his bushesHe wonderin' what's up in his bushes, that's my shooter layin' in a ghillie, silly
She got A-plus-plus head, but that kitty iffy
'D think she had a BBL, this bitch got itty-bitty titties
'D think the Glocky caught a virus off the— pfft, switchy glitchy
Dude ain't have a tad bit of aim, I know he pissed he missed me
I'm like a myth around that bitch, I know that Ypsi' miss me
You know the streets get deep, you know this shit be fishy
I ain't wanna draw attention, popped out with the mini blicky
I ain't played games since a kid, don't try to Miniclip me
Comfortable in Penn Town, me and Boor in Sticky Rickies
Told her put her head down, all that tryna give me hickeysShe like, "Really, Jimmy?"
There go Mr. Moissanite, he rockin' dilly-willy
You gotta get it by your dolo, ain't no pity in me
Couldn't be like Greg, nah, I couldn't let 'em Wimpy Kid me
They like, "Really, Jimmy?"
Pop-out, three milly, I just blew through fifty cities
They like, "Really, Jimmy?"
