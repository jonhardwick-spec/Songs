[Intro]
(
Enrgy made this one
)
[Verse 1: Baby Ghost]
She was tryna give me the pussy, but I don't wanna hit it
Only reason I say fuck your mans 'cause I know who did it
I don't really be lovin' on these hoes, I just like to hit 'em
It be too much fire comin' out the Drac', that's why I like pistols
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
She keep tryna give me the pussy, but I want her sister
She keep tryna give me the pussy, but I want some chicken
This lil' bitch just like my Glocky, she gon' end up switchin'
Tron Madden, if I call the play, them boys gon' end up blitzin'
[Verse 3: Baby Ghost]
I can already see it, he gon' end up snitchin'
If he don't come outside, I'ma start shootin' through the kitchen
Bro caught a body, he ain't beat it 'cause he ain't kill his witness
Every time I get a look, I beat it, you know I'm vicious
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Got your bitch eatin' dick and I just know you kissed her
Too attached, she tryna double back, but shit, you know I spinned her
Ask what's the score, we got a lot, they got a little
How the fuck all the dimes from high school dropped to nickels?
