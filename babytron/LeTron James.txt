Will, stop playin' with these niggas

ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
My last bitch broke my heart and left a nigga empty
So, cut it out with the love, 'cause it don't tempt me
Pocket full of blues, so the opps full of envy
Punches deadly, go and tell the clerks, "I'm on a juggin' frenzy"
You talk a lot of shit, I hope that you believe in Jesus
'Cause if a hollow hit yo' ass, then you gon' prolly need him
But if it hit the neck up, you gon' prolly meet him
The only thing I fight is demons, run up, I'ma leave him
I heard it's money on my head, bitch, come noodle me (Come and do it)
ShittyBoyz losing, huh, bitch that's new to me (It is)
I'm one of a kind, bitch, it ain't no two of me (No, it ain't)
Don't forget who I am, ain't no fooling me
I'ma make you proud granny, know you watching me
(R.I.P.)
And if you tryna beef with bro, then you're an opp to me
And that's your ass if we catch you, and no coppin' please (Rrah)
I'm the realest bitch, ain't no probably (Woo)
You fucked up fuckin' up, I hope you know that shit (Woo)
This bitch in love, get the phones, then I ho that bitch (Haha)
Bright ass future, but I came from hopelessness (All facts)
Stop askin' how to ball, I don't coach and shit
You can give a bitch the world, but she'll still want the moon
For all the hoes that did me bold, y'all gon' feel it too
Huh, matter fact, y'all gon' feel it soon
I don't do the drugs, hit the boof, and let it heal the wounds
Good Yeezys on, I'm feelin' like I'm Kanye
Had to block that bitch like Gobert, 'cause she was on games
Hit the staples center off the punch, call me LeTron James
I just
wan't
my team to win, I'm feelin' like LeBron James
I wish I still had a heart that I could love with
I just thank God I still got hands that I could jugg with
Watch your mouth, you talkin' to the source, I'm the plug bitch
Ninety-nine percent valid rate, watch the dumps hit
And, if I up the stash, nigga, that's a scary sight (It is)
Guarantee you up the stash, that's a pair of mikes (Lame)
Coming up on hot shit, drop your Fahrenheit (Bitch)
Came from the dirt, but I'm heading to the paradise
Hit my line if you bangin' with the bank accounts
You rather try and steal the sauce, that's the Plankton route (Do it)
Earthquake in this .40, pull up, shake the house (Rah)
Clayvon on tip, if he pull up, you won't make it out
Talkin' wet, that won't change 'til my last breath
Neiman's addict, walkin' wet 'til my last step
Got a .4-0, he tryna ball, get his ass swept
Me and Stan the real splash bros, you can ask Steph (Ballin')
Life's a game, you go to Hell or you go to Heaven (You do)
Life's a gamble, roll the dice, you might get a seven (You might)
You gotta learn the biggest L's are your biggest lessons
I got a gift in this shit, that's my biggest blessing
Fuck the opps, they some well known shoplifters
And I can teach you how to ball, feel like Doc Rivers
Ju Sleaze'll let it squeeze, that's my top hitter
You a fag lyin' on yo' dick, you did not hit her
.223s, ask Chris Paul where they Andrew Wiggins
I was raised for the winning, came with the sinning
This moonrock a mo'fucker, got my head spinning
Told the jugg "Just trust the process", like he Ben Simmons
I ain't saying that I'm undefeated with the hands
What I'm saying is I'm undefeated with the scams (I am)
Used to be broke, then I changed my game plan
When you up, watch your back, you can't trust your main mans
Turn around three times, that's a ten-eighty
Spinned that bitch three times, that's a ten-eighty (Got her dizzy)
Loub's on my feet, they cost about ten-eighty (Add it up)
Pocket full of rugrats, I came up off ten babies
A hundred times a hundred, ain't no time for actin' fake (A thousand)
Put my hands on the Visa, watch me activate (Charged up)
And if I'm eatin' good, my dawg gettin' half the plate
Come on dude, you only bust when you masturbate (Yeah)
Put your all into that shit, you might leave with nothing (You might)
Twenty Visas in my pocket, I'ma leave with something (Punchin' up)
You better watch your back, boy, 'cause them demons coming
Free pro's on the road, won't stop 'til I need for nothing
This the realest shit I wrote, I put my heart on it (
Will, stop playin' with these niggas
)
Plaid shirt on, I cannot be heartbroken
Push her head down, and I guarantee she start chokin'
Jumped in the deep end, now my hoodie got a shark on it
