[Verse 1: TrDee]
I'm OT, somewhere chilling on the beach
Fly a lil' baddie out, only if you be discreet
Don't let the glasses fool you, I am not a geek
I'm the type to still run it up if I ain't have no feet
Dick put her straight to sleep, this some NyQuil
Still reminiscing 'bout the wounds that did not heal
Damn, this bitch thicker than some oatmeal
Please tell me how you slid down and ain't get no kill
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Hunnid rounder, leave a Scat Pack with no wheels
I don't gotta let that bitch off, I bet bro will
Shooting layups but you miss them bitches? You got no skill
Have my shooters run the triangle like I'm coach Phil
I'm too blowed
Three-five of the White Runtz, this shit too strong
Bankroll sеven-seven likе Manute Bol
Push a button in the spaceship, now the coupe gone
[Verse 3: StanWill]
RIP Virgil, if I spin around, it's a X on me
In a bay, thirty in my clip, that's a Steph on me
Like it's payday, fuck around, drop a check on me
Pull up, drop fifty, I ain't even gotta stretch on me
Drop a couple shells, fuck around, get his taco blew
I don't like to wrestle, if it's up, put the Glock on you
Lil' bro ain't jamming 201s if he slide on you
You ain't doing shit for yo team, you don't lob no 'oops
