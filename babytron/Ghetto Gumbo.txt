[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I've been up for a week, sippin' juice, don't ask me how I'm tired
Huh, ayy, I've been up for a week, sippin' juice, don't ask me how I'm tired
I ain't take a nap or nothin', shit, I think it's how I'm wired
Everybody in here rap they life, you be around the liars
Credit cards and fetty, we'll pull up, put your town on fire
In the field in mirror tints, I'm LT lookin' out the vizor
Ain't no playin' jumpin' in that water, we gon' drown the drivers
I'm in that water, no goggles, no snorkel
Hop up out that Jaguar throwin' bullets like I'm Bortles
In the mall, shoppin' by myself, I'm actin' like I'm normal
We gon' suit up, we gon' boot up, we gon' leavе his family formal, no hat
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
I'm in here dancin' with my arm in the pot likе Puffy
Palm Angels jumpsuit on, but I'm scruffy
I hit it once, I'm tryna stretch it like Luffy
Three-five of ghetto Gumbo, I smell musty
It came high, but I adjust for my custies
Let unc' use the scale and he gave it back dusty
I know they comin' back for this shit, you gotta trust me, nigga
