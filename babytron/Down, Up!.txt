We'll now begin the pushup section
Ready? I'm ready

Down

[Chorus]
Shit, you better get down
Boy, it's a stickâ€” (
Up, three

Time to put your hands down
Time to pick a blick up (
Up, four
)
Actin' like they stayed down
Whole time, they switched up (
Up, five
)
Spent a long time down
But I spend the rest up (
Up, six
)
Muddy six put me down
But the Yerc' woke me up (
Up, seven
)
Everything upside down
Like, was down really up? (
Up, eight
)
On the top, lookin' down
Y'all gon' have to get it up (
Up, nine

Heard that dawg was talkin' down
Seen his whip and lit it up (

Alright, let me stop bullshitting, what pushup is this? (
Fourteen

It's only one way from down
And that's up (
Up, sixteen

If the shit goes down
Guarantee, we pick it up (
Up, seventeen
)
If I'm ever feelin' down
Bitch, the zaddy, lift me up, (
Up, eighteen

That's when I started to chase dreams (
Up, nineteen

The last time I had a Sprite clean (
Up, twenty

Down, up (
Up, twenty-two

Catch him while the price down
'Cause we know it's goin' up (
Up, twenty-three

Tell her, "Put that face down"
Tell her, "Toot that ass up" (
Up, twenty-four
)
Heard the boys tracked him
Hope he put that bag up (
Up, twenty-five
)
Lay down or stay down
Get your soul snatched up (
Up, twenty-six
)
Double that, stay down
Shit, it's time to stack up (
Up, twenty-seven

Turn that bullshit down
Unless it's us, turn it up (
Up, twenty-nine
)
I can turn a bitch down
I can turn a bitch up (
Up, thirty
)
No hat
Try and add me up, bitch, the fit cost (Thirty-one)
Try and add me up, bitch, a pendant cost (Thirty-two)
We get the bowls for fifteen, we get 'em all for (Thirty-three)
The most dominant, I feel like Shaq in the (Thirty-four)
