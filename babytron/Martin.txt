[Intro: StanWill]
It's Lando, yo bitch know, don't let yo bitch go, nigga
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Cold lil' bitch like Cleopatra
Got two hands to swipe, I ain't beating asses
Shooter accurate as hell, boy, you see the glasses
Me love a bitch? Boy, I'd rather eat a cactus
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Real east nigga, took your bitch 'cause I could
Do what? To who? Boy, I wish your ass would
Please play with yo bitch and not me, understood?
Boy, you are not street just because you from the hood
[Verse 3: Skilla Baby]
Lando, tell them that shit wack
And turn that music down 'fore we scrap
Fuck nigga get ice, tell your mans chill
If Tron don't beat his ass, I know Stan will
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Seen this shit coming like I had a UAV
Just know I did fraud if you seen the Uber leave
Bando like Steve Kerr, we the super team
Look in the mirror for a second, bitch, you ain't me
