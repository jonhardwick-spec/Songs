[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Ball hogging for the times they ain't throw a pass
My bitch cold, you can't fuck with her frozen-ass
Up until the nut, that's how long my emotions last
Stretch doggy bone with the chop like aerobics class
Off-White on the tee, this ain't Aeropostale
Breathtaking-ass Glock knock the air up out you
Fraud philosopher, I feel like Aristotle
Come and get yo bitch, dawg, she loose off a pair of bottles
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Boy, you scared of the throttle, I don't press the brakes
Walk around with some heavy thrust but I'm a featherweight
In LA, Benihibachi, I need extra steak
This lil' bitch a fucking geek, swear the head was great
Yao Ming off the Runtz, keep a Houston Rocket
I won't use my knuckles, boy, you would get blew like Sonic
Lando blowing Wedding Cake, that shit super toxic
Left the Crocs at the crib, had the Gucci floppers
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Drowning in the pussy, I'ma hit her with the tongue out
I ain't hit yo bitch to be a hunnid, we just hung out
She was playing with some noodles, now she on the block strung out
They messing in the rain [?] my face when the sun out
Don't play games with me, you better treat me like the weird kid
Stan bring the hoes, told Tron bought car heads
[?] rappers really something that we call feds
She wanna pull up to the stu', bitch wanna do my ad libs
