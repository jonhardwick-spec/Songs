[Verse]
Big FN make it hit, they say roger that
Walk in Ocean Prime big high like, "Where the lobster at?"
I'm a flashy guy, step on these? I'ma pop his ass
Whole QP of Turtle Pie, boy, this not a half
7.62 give a dreadhead a Steve Harvey
Feel like Tim Duncan, posting up while the heat guard me
Head fucked up out the pape', I can't sleep hardly
Do a trick in the Hellcat, now the sleeve gnarly
Yeah, I'ma spend this shit, real shit, I could die tomorrow
Boy, it's crunch time right now, fuck slime tomorrow
Stan finna go OT, I got some slides to borrow
You tryna sell a lil' three-five? I'll make it five tomorrow
Snatch my chain? Man, you ain't gon' snatch this, bitch
Doing 120 off the Wock', I might crash this bitch
Flashy shit, 'Miri sag, I might flash the stick
At the phone store, probably in the back stacking bricks
If you put yo mind to it then the world is yours
Bitch, I ain't got a single manner, I don't hold no doors
Treat that bitch like she Dora, tell her go explore
Put it in the air, brother man, if it's smoke, it's war
Two sticks, I'll let 'em spark like a eagle scout
I'm the real road runner, just say that you need a route
Bitch called me "Jimmy", fuck around and brought the sleezy out
Bro subzero with that Ford, he got the freezer out
Boy, bring yo ass over here, we got the heaters out
Scam dancing with the scam fam, we brought the Visas out
I got a fetish with Dior, you took the Fila route
European kicks with the spikes, I took the FIFA route
Dawg talking out his ass, someone better tell him
Ran it up off that one shit, boy, they finna mail 'em
I got BINs, I got hunnid if I sell 'em
Bro Big Show in that kitchen, watch how quick he press 'em
Skinny jeans, small tee, I don't rock no mediums
Lil' new spaceship, you know this bitch take premium
Speaking of the opps, if I see 'em then I'm leaving 'em
Tron made a way, back then they ain't believe in him, ayy
Headhunter trick, I'm like, "Come on, you my fave, boo"
Looking in the mirror, "You the GOAT, boy, who made you?"
Finna get that bitch that lil' wig, come and get a, ayy
Bitch, I know you really freaky, come and get a taste, boo
Dee, you tripping, she threw that ass back then he started humping
UFO, skrrt-skrrt, yeah, boy, them Martians coming
I ain't lying, bitch, you see these cards, they hitting for a hunnid
Slam dunking 201s, bitch, I'm starting over Drummond
5.56 hit his house, I had his mama running
Dracs, AKs, they thought they seen Osama boming
Dre dropped the presents, hell nah, he ain't Obama cousin
Swear to God I hate beef, too bad that my choppa love it
