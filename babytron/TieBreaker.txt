[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
The Devil chasing me but I don't give a fuck, I'm chasing M's
Heard karma on my ass, tell him that I'm waiting then
Lay up with a bitch? Hell nah, I'm gon' break the rim
Talking slam dunk, when I leave her crib I'm making ten
[Verse 2: StanWill &
Sweezee Don
]
Habanero talk, boy, I'm feeling like the Spice God
Too immortal with the 201s, I'm the Swipe God
Tough as hell behind the keyboard, you the Type God
Fight who? Bro'll send you up, you will fight God (

[Verse 3: Sweezee Don]
I just hit the booth and punch, I don't brainstorm
Bruh got me looking like a rapper with the chains on
Bossed up then I put the whole gang on
You a lil' nigga in the club getting rained on
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Good day, want play? I got six phones
Do my punches hit? Shit like Thanos with the six stones
Can't trust these hoes, they walk around on they tiptoes
But if she look good, I'm gon' see what her shit hit for
