[Intro]
The next good one, just keep the next good one
(
Don't you know you won the Lotto?
)
Nyah
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Milita, long live $cam, huh, you know?
Huh, ayy, ayy
[Verse]
Ride around, two deep, just me and fine shit
If she can't see that I'm a blessing, then she blind, shit
All I like is bad shit, can't tell you what my type is
Guaranteed you tellin' if they tell you what your rights is
I'm the one above the plug, I'm like the light switch
We'll put a human being on a price list
Heart cold than a bitch, bring me some ice picks
Unky rock the ACG's 'cause he don't really like Ricks
Know some robbers that'll show you what a heist is
Doggybonе a bitch, he prolly wear a size six
Born brokе, die rich, you know how life get
Tux in here t'd off the Don, they ran through five fits
Put the do-it's on the Delta, they a flight risk
You would think I'm on the injured list, I got an ice wrist
Lil' cuz ain't got a whip cause all he buy is blicks
High efficient stain hitter, lil' neph' a Tide stick
Haha, steps ahead, bitch, I'm a strategizer
Thanksgiving, turned my Sprite into an apple cider
Christmas time, jack catchin', I'm an apple biter
They done freed Rio, shit, the Mitten back on fire
I told Cole to pass the lemonade, I'm feelin lyrical
Off an eighth of psilocybin in here, feelin' spiritual
Bein' broke a sickness, you gon' need a healin' miracle
Stop sayin free your bro, they caught him stealin' cereal
Spllin' Wock' at Eddie V's, ain't got no etiquette
Then hit your block and light it up, I'm tryna set a scent
The denim capital like nah, these not no VETEMENTS
I got 'em sick and I can tell them boys ain't got no medicine
Life a game of chess but you'll prolly checker it
I'll pull this bit' from anywhere, I'm Dražen Petrović
Pills, pint of Tris', and some 'za, I got a medic kit
If you don't hear the LOTTO tag then acapella it
Jeans like a pizza puff, the pockets mozzeralla-ish
Where the fuck the celibates? Can we just stop the sellin' it?
Granny asked me 'bout my pill, I said I popped a peppermint
Nyah-ah, ah, ah
If he say he dope, then I guess I'm a fetty brick
When gang step around this bitch, you see some yeti prints
Fake deezy so the clerk callin' me yeti-diot
M-E, what that stand for? Mr. Excellent
