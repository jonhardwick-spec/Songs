[Intro]
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
We sit around sparking 'Woods up but this is not a camp
Rich got the peach Crush, turned it to a lava lamp
Bust the SBA for fifty-five then do my Sada dance
Lil' bougie bitch with the grip, pussy got some clamps
[Verse 2: RMC Mike]
Dawg walked up a lil' too fast, I just shot a fan
Underwater fucking on yo' bitch, I'm the Aquaman
I been getting money since niggas was selling five for ten
In the Bay going hyphy, watch a nigga ghost ride the Benz
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
I'ma jam the chip and slide, never fucked with pots and pans
Stepping on shit with two straps, I'm the Prada Man
Dunking' with the chop, knock yo' wig off like Juwanna Mann
In a blacked-out Suburban, looking like Obama mans
[Verse 4: RMC Mike]
Put the strap down and get knocked out, I got a lot of hands
When I was broke, I was lonely, now I'm up, I got a lot of friends
Told Tron to meet me at the booth, it's time to politic
Me and bro gon' fuck around and make some of the hottest shit
