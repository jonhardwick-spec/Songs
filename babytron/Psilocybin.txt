[Verse 1: BabyTron &
Peezy
]
Floatin' off the psilocybin, bouncin' 'round like Super Mario
Go to war wit' the militia, you gon' have to get yo' army cloned
Flyin' in from Michigan, could tell 'cause I got Cartis on
Turn the celebration to a tragedy, do parties wrong
Closet look like Narnia, designer, that shit color-coded
Hustle for three hunnid nights, I bet I spend the summer loaded
Brodie came in sparkin' pictures, had to strike a pose for Logan
Simbaa right behind him, twenty coffee cups, he pourin' potions
I done overdid it on the geekin', need a lower dosage
How you ballin'? Boy, that shit nonprofit, you just focus hopin'
Goin' through the motions, up and down, just catch me rollercoastin'
Would've thought I drovе over a skunk, 'cause what I'm rollin' potent
Pop-up shop in Houston, nеxt day, catch me at the show in Oakland
Crankin' off an Addy, my bitch whinin', tryna blow my focus
Said you need some yeah from what's-his-name, just hit the sto', he posted
Boy, you bogus, I don't even switch lanes when I'm goin' bowling
(Boy, you bogus, I don't even switch lanes when I'm goin' bowling)
Pshh
(Boy, you bogus, I don't even switch lanes when I'm goin' bowling)
