[Intro: TrDee]
Y'all
tripping, Rizzy, turn this shit up
You ain't never had to— (Yeah, okay)
Rizzy got the heat
[Verse 1: TrDee]
You ain't ever had to strap yo' nuts on
If she don't text you back, she probably getting fucked on
If you ever say, "It's up," you getting dunked on
She a freaky girl, why the fuck you put the cuffs on?
She gon' suck the dick before we fuck because it's mandatory
Turn his block to
Call Of Duty
, camping in his territory
You can't fuck with us, boy, you ain't even in our category
Stop playing with the gang, bitch, real ShittyBoyz shit, come on
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Okay, life like a toilet, they be pissed 'cause that shit on me
I bеat and picked his ass off, you can't pick on me
Mike Amiri tripping, hе got way too many rips on me
Used to brick a lot, now every shot I take a swish only
It's a lot of double cups in here, my babies pouring potions up
Lab pendants off the balaclavas, bitches know it's us
How it's smoke with us? You can't afford the shit we rolling up
You can't hit the bitches that I hit, boy, you ain't G.O.A.T. enough
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
S Mode in the McLaren, finna drift some'
Brodie Deacon Jones for that sack, he gon blitz some' (Phew)
I'ma need a four to take a nap, I'ma tryna sip some (Phew-phew)
You can see the pole, that bitch attached, I'm tryna lift some' (Tryna lift some', phew)
Take the mask off and walk 'em down bare face
It's a dirty game, we ain't finna play the fair way
Overnight shippies, jacks coming through the airway (Through the airway, brrt)
Shit (Shit)
