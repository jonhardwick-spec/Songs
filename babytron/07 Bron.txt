[Verse 1: TrDee]
Spot jumpin' like LeBron in 2007
Niggas ain't even got a whip, that's why they always steppin'
She come back 'cause I always bless her like a reverend
Bet you that I blow up out of nowhere just like 9/11
Don't try to coach me on this shit, 'cause you was never where I'm at
Got Glockie while I'm shittin', you know I can never lack
You'll really be surprised who'd stab you in your back
Niggas think they competition, oh, they must be smokin' crack
That bitch somewhere in the blendеr, man, I left her lookin' dizzy
I'm not dyin', gettin' rich, I bеt I'm rich before I'm fifty
I could probably hit the mall and blow your salary, no kizzy
Why the fuck you talkin' crazy? You ain't even got no blickie
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Dog Shit Militia, bitch, that's on every song
You know what the fuck it is, you know what the fuck it was, you know what the fuck it's gon' be, huh
It's a hundred sticks in the whip
When I cut that blender on, I threw your bitch in the mix
Heard these buff pockets swole even though I'm ripped than a bitch
Angelina Jolie, I make my bitch get a 'script
Say I'm him, bitch, I'm hip
All these diamonds got me icier than George Gervin (Bling)
Talkin' hot until he ended up in that morgue furnace (Yop)
Get online and play with punches, I'm just bored surfin'
How she think her nigga got a bag? He can't afford Birkins
Get the lo' and load them blicks, we at his door lurkin'
Hit his ho and sent a pic', I left his core hurtin'
Mean as fuck with BBL, she can't be more perfect
All this Christian in my closet, I can make a ho worship
Goal one, make a milli', two, make a milli' twice
Diamonds multi-color in my pendant, you got Dilly ice
Left me in the cold, I bought a Goose for all them chilly nights
Me, I'm chasin' fifty M's, all brodie want is fifty pints
