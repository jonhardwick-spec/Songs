[Intro]
(
RJ always tripping, man, RJ always tripping
)
[Hook]
You wasn't there when I called on you, huh
So now I gotta ball on you
Nike tech full of shit, watch me jog on you
The bag in the air, gotta do the Moss on you
Ran off with the bag, now the Hawks on you
Told my side bitch like, "My bitch'll put the paws on you"
Gang full of hellhounds, put my dawgs on you
Givenchy tee, euro step, finna sauce on you
[Verse 1]
Off the Runtz, feel like Darth Vader
You better tuck the white hoes before Art take 'em
Seen dawg at the function, had his heart racing
If I see the opps, like my hair, I'll start banging
Threesome with two dimes, yeah, I'm big turnt
Let me find out you smoke tails till yo lips burnt
Huh, ran it up hard as fuck, thеy need to switch turfs
God, forgive me, all them fraud trips, I skip church
This a hunnid roundеr, who this bitch gon' hit first?
Twenty-eight Amiri stuffed with salad, now my hips hurt
Slam dunking yo freak, this a big vert
You see that chip reader? Take a card and insert
I don't serve fiends, bitch, I'm eating off of Apple bricks
You need a big-ass hat, Colin Kaepernick
I think yo bitch wanna fuck 'cause I'm talented
I think Stan got a aimbot, that boy accurate
Punch God, yes, yes, I'm immaculate
Lil' bitch playing with my balls like she practicing
When it's beef, you duck, on some Daffy shit
I'll have the Glock chokeslam you, I ain't grappling
In outer space, got a deuce in my moon mist
Dusty-ass boy, threw his ass a broomstick
Ran through six toothpicks in Ruth Chris
Turn a blue strip to a, I got the blueprint
Chillimo, I got every tech known to man
I done seen it all, I ain't never have an open hand
Oh, you wanna fight? Come on, throw 'em then
Nah, for real, use yo head 'fore we blow it in
Big-ass Guccis got me tripping like I'm RJ
I turn nothing into something, feeling like I'm Scarface
The whole gang rocking BAPE, bitch, this the shark way
"What the fuck do you do?", bitch, I do card play
