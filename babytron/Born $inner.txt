[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, Jose
Ayy (Ayy)
Ayy, ayy (
Jose the Plug
)
Ha-ha, huh, huh (ShittyBoyz)
[Verse]
Mm-hmm, yeah, yes, bitch
Checklist checked the fucked up, I made a check, bitch
Play with us? Oh shit, that's a death wish
Stretch shit, boy, we'll press shit
I'm a asshole, swear to God my ex pissed
Told Siri shut the fuck up, I missed my exit
All this drip got me walking 'round looking like, yes, bitch
That's it, say the wrong shit and get yo head split
Stop posting old-ass pics, fuck the swag you had
I be talking like I only punch but I can cash a bag
Unc' stepping on the snow, dawg look like a avalanche
Would've rocked skinnies in the '80s, fuck the Hammer pants
New Chanel sneaks, I moonwalk and do my scammer dance
In my Bathing Ape, monkey nuts going bananas, man
Japanese cuisine, Japanese all on my Fanta can
I be eating lamb off the scams, no, I ain't hamming [?]
Been scamming grannies, fuck Betty and fuck Sharon
Been a rude fuck so it's always been like fuck sharing
Last bitch took the good out me, now it's like fuck caring
Lil' MILF choosing, I might fuck around and fuck Karen
If you be real quiet, you can hear Dior squeaks
Punch seven pairs so I guess it's a Dior week
I fucked her, bought her a bag, she my Dior freak
If I could, I'll punch the Scat Pack with Dior seats
Yes, bitch, yes, bitch, I'm a fancy guy
AK-47 got some and some rapid fire
Trunk got some heavy ammunition, there's some jacks inside
If you question me, cross you over like I'm Allen I
Like I'm Ivo
T-Rex barking in the engine like a dino
I don't sing but the choppa hit him like a high note
I be up in Saks itching like I might swipe those
Yeah, I was never scared to get mine
Keep a .4-0 like it's military midnight
Jumping out with drip, bitch thinking I'm a fish, ah
Think I'm the shit 'cause I hit every bitch, ah
.223s hanging out his ear like some AirPods
Shit I'm dunking out of town, yeah, it'll scare Bron
Off-White 1s, smoking Runtz, call me "Air Tron"
Play with me? Headshot, huh, there's God
Been a cocky fuck, told my teachers, "Call me 'Big Tron'"
If it's smoke, ceiling fan, it's on
Apple bricks got me upping dog shit now
Switching lanes in 'Cats got me looking like a lick now
How you in a 'Cat chasing rats?
I think it's Tom and Jerry
Smoking lemon cherry in this bitch, I think I popped her cherry
Looking like the prince from Great Britain, how I rocked these Harry’s
Them lil'-ass lobster tails you eat?
Them is not no Larry
That lil' shit you smushed in that Dutch? It is not za
Ayy, if we get flicked, boy, it is not mine
Posted on that corner, leave him holy like a stop sign
I could be fucking Marty McFly, I ain't got time
I could be fucking Conor McGregor, wouldn't box you
Wake up, make fifty cents to make sure I am not you
I'm starting to think Tron and Tron is the top two
Let me see a portal to that M, I'ma hop through
I don't need a shout-out, bitch, I damn near got a hundred K
Let the [?] out? Now he dead 'cause it's a hundred K
Feeling like I'm Jeter in his prime off these hundred plays
If you a sweetie with a .9, we gon' munch away
Took the .9 right out his hands, now I'm Iguodala
Got explosive tips but it ain't shit to switch to hollows
If the floor wet, I'm probably 'round 'cause the drip gon' follow
Only been punching once a day, it's time to switch to combos
Human Race, huh, fuck up out my face
We just beat his ass so bad, I called him "Dr. Dre"
They told me I'll sit up on that bench if I dropped the play
They told bro he wasn't really 'bout it so he copped a K
Stopped going to church 'cause I feel like I ain't fit in
Like, why I'm standing here and I'm
sinning
for them big BINs?
Like right before mass, I wasn't tryna get a trip in
But everyday I'm blessed, thank the Man that I be shitting
