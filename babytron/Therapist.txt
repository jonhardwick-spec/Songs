[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat

(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
It ain't shit free in life, you gotta get it out the mud
I just wanted me some paper, I ain't wanna be a thug
I don't really fuck with niggas, they be scared to show you love
Baby, come and put that pussy on me, your shit like a drug
It's gon' be some niggas hatin', but don't listen to the chatter
My lil' bitch done sent a booty pic like, "Look, it's gettin' fatter"
Used to wanna be Jeff Hardy, so my Glocky got a ladder
You a lame talkin' 'bout that bitch and you ain't never had her
[Verse 2: StanWill]
You ain't never had a run like this
Switchie blickiе, you ain't never shot a gun like this
You ain't nеver had no funds like this
You ain't never had a sack, but when I see me one, I blitz
Huh, like if it's money on the floor, bitch, I'm spread even
Why they want me dead? Only thing I want is dead people
Bet I pause him quick with this bitch, that's where plan lead you
Need to seek some psychiatric help if you think Stan need you
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
My ho foreign, but the car American
Used to play the whore shoes back with Marvin Harrison
I can never love a bitch, to use my heart's embarassing
Catch him lackin' at the tele, we gon' spark the Sheraton
Treat the mic like my therapist
Wock pints, steak bites and Asparagus
Carti buffaloes, they whiter than a Claritan
Bitch, you know I'm arrogant
DSM, LMT the long moolah terrorist
