[Intro: Certified Trapper]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
Ayy
Fah, fah, fah, fah, fah
Fah, fah fah, fah
[Verse 1: Certified Trapper]
Off with his shit
Put you in a blender, have you all in the mix
Everything bust, ain't no flaws in my shit
She know what she doin', suck the balls and the dick
Nah, you a lick, you can't ball with my clique
I'ma ball with my brothers, I'ma ball 'til the end
On a higher level, hundred-plus on my kit
Hundred-plus in the drum plus one in my shit
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Fah, fah, fah, fah, you better not run in this bitch
Marshmallow Snowballs, gums numb off a hit
In here runnin' from the dick, she gon' cum off the tip
I'm a blue-strip bandit, only come for them strips
Tell the bitch, "Head down," I don't hug, I don't kiss
When I up, I don't miss, boy, I punch, I don't kick
You can get a head start, bet a dub I don't trip
I'm an outsider, 'less it's with the plug, I don't click
