Yeah, it's like 8 in the morning, but the block still jumpin'
Fuckin' around, by 9 o'clock, I done made like twenty-somethin'
It's 9:30 now, it's en route, just know the money comin'10 o'clock on the dot, already uppin' money, thumbin'
It's 10:30, let me call your bitch and see if she gon' cook me somethin'
I check the news, it's hot outside, call Tron, bring out a hundred-somethin'
By 10:35, them robbers be done came out, took 'em somethin'By 10:45, I be done popped out with a book or somethin'
It's 11 now, I'm fresh and I done made a fifty
I fuck around and go to Dayshift just to see some tittiеs
Your bitch called me around noon, told that ho I'm busy1 p.m., I got a head appointmеnt, this bitch better not spin me
Nigga, 'bout 1:30, had to pull up on the drank man, I'm dizzy
At 2, I had to pull up on my new ho, she like Nicki
It's 2:30, ridin' 'round with two thirties with meMatter fact, it's 3:30, I got two 30s in me
At 4, I heard a young nigga got dropped, I yelled, "Ricky"
At 5, went to the crib and changed my clothes, threw on them Rickys
In rush hour, got that Chris Tucker with meTryna pull a stunt like Jackie Chan, that big fucker with me
Yeah, now it's 6, I'm spinnin' blocks, pulled up on Tron
He was in that big-body Benz, I told him let me drive
Shit, it's 7, the mall close at 8 if we finna go shopHeadin' out the 'Set at 8:30, finna hit the block
Yeah, it's 9 o'clock, finna get ready to hit the club
I told my ho she better work, 'cause this the night I might spend a dub
It's 10, we standin' on the booth, all these hoes looseLet an opp walk up up in this bitch, bet all the bros shoot
Yeah, it's 11, we left Annex, went to Truth
Tron trippin' off the shrooms, he left a twenty in the roof
Me and TeeJaee finna skate and take these lil' hoes to the roomWould've grabbed a Bnb, but our accounts fully blew
Hoes started fightin' in the club, they kicked us out at 11:30
When we left, we had to pull off on the police, they tried to search us
Hit the side street and cut the lightsHop on foot and hit the bushes, they can't lock me up tonight
Come on
Right now, we hidin' behind a bando, hopin' the boys don't see us
Only time you see me scared is runnin' from them people
Shit, there they go, they flicked the lights, it's time to hit the fenceGotta ditch the switch, they catch me with it, I'ma sit the bench
We can come back and get 'em, so just hide the blicks
Let me see your phone, I'll call my mama, she'll send us a Lyft
It's 2 a.m., it ain't no drivers, let's go steal a whipLike the Kia Boyz, we used a USB, peeled, then dippedYeah, we got away
On the way back to the room, we got in another chase
How this finna play out? Only ridin' with a quarter tankLeft them fuckers in the past and now we headed towards the bank
I got a deuce of Trish left and it's like 4 in the morning
I'm fuckin' off with a bitch I ain't supposed to be with, I'm like Tory
It's been a long night, word to Trapper, shit, I'm damn near snorin'5 in the morning, zoomin' to the Lab, now we recordin'
It's like 6, I'm kinda sleepy and my cup almost gone
Ain't talk to my bitch all night, she ringin' both of my phones
Man, I think I'm finna go homeTonight was almost good for real, but now the cops at the door, man
