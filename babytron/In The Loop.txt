[Intro: MJPAID]
(
Reuel, stop playin' with these niggas
)
Damn
[Verse 1: MJPAID]
I wake up in the mornin' and I'm rack chasin'
You don't ever pass the rock, bitch, you stat chasin'
ATM Jam era had my back breakin'
Niggas spent that PUA, now you back basic
[Verse 2: Fordio]
She still end up in the loop even though she taken
Lately I don't wanna talk, it don't include payments
This ain't
Call of Duty
, [?] give a nigga tracers
I heard his tape, and that bitch was all mid-range
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Said he had some loud, opened the bag and I ain't hear nothin'
When I rock Essentials only time I fear somethin'
Teeth straight, don't need a grill, might get my ears flooded
I just made my pop a lava lamp, hеard you be beer chuggin'
[Verse 4: MJPAID]
With that weak-ass BIN, you ain't clearin' nothin'
Monеy counter loud as hell, I ain't hearin' nothin'
Fear of God only time a nigga fearin' somethin'
'Fore I ever got a bitch, I was gettin' punches
