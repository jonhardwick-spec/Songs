[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
Ayy, ayy
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
Huh, yeah, okay
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Range limitless, aim, finish him
If I pass the bag, I might get flashed, Jason Williams
Chasing millions, you chase a bitch with fake Brazilians
Bitches favorites words when they see me, "Ain't that really him?"
I'ma call habibi, if it's problems, he gon' bomb his ass
Stainless-ass weapon but the 'Miris, I just dropped some ash
Fried crab legs from Japan, these exotic snacks
Backwards-ass songs, you be lying, need a gown and cap
In a Hellcat, see a bag? I'ma pounce on that
Really like that, if I fall, I'ma bounce right back
Lil' bitch head knock me out, think I found my match
Me and gang having drip wars, we might drown in Saks
7.62s point-blank, you can't counter that
Touchdown from a trip, got the money counter pape'
You don't know the sound of that
I could probably punch a phone quicker than you count a stack
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Pull up to the scene, PRPs off the Bathing Ape
Think you allergic to the money, you ain't touching pape'
Mama like, "Why you got a gun?", I say it's for the hate
I can't help you with yo problems, call that nigga "Jason"
Smoking on some thrax, Turtle Pie, you cannot match with me
Turn around, baby, throw it back and make it clap for me
Need about seven for a verse, I do not rap for free
Heard you got that hell up in yo head, girl, I gotta see
I don't gotta tap but I'm stamped, I don't need a letter
Bro, what pressure? That shit like a feather
You can thank moi when you see her head is getting better
Huh, two hoes, we finna have a double header
I don't gotta cap when I rap, I speak on what I did
It don't take more than a stack to knock 'em off the grid
Starting to think this bitch a cannibal, she like to swallow kids
I don't wanna listen to yo songs, you always telling fibs
