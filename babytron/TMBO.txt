[Intro: Bankroll Reese]
Yeah, 146
What up, Tron?
(
313 Mafia
)
Yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
[Verse 1: Bankroll Reese]
Say I'll walk a nigga down, bitch, you know them steps steep
Ain't never running up no pape', these niggas got two left feet
.223s rip a cow, try yo luck, you dead meat
Get to spraying in the crowd and turn it to a track meet
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Get to spinning in the 'Cat and turn it to a auto show
Gatorade with a six of Tech, turn my baller on
Shop till the mall closed, lil' bitch, I brought a roll
Why every time they talk crazy the collar on?
[Verse 3: Bankroll Reese]
When I put my mask down they say I kick like Rey Mysterio
Told my ex bitch that I'll be the shit but she ain't hear me though
If he playing with them 'bows, he get holes likе a Cheerio
Have yo bitch do the navi' on the road, shе ain't Siri though
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Punch God, all scams, you won't catch me near a 'bow
Do the dash on Wockiana, feeling like I'm steering slow
NFL thigh pad, I came through with Amiri roll
Gang walked in with Fear of God but ain't no fear in bro
