[Verse 1: J1Hunnit]
Look, I got an RPG with switch, I think I'm Oppenheimer
It's for you weenie-ass niggas, little Oscar Mayers
Turn his hood to Halloween, he think he Michael Myers
We drop fish uncooked with double-basket fryers
Chop sing with a hand movement, DSM the choir
I'm on a three-way call, I think I'm Liz McGuire
Cut this nigga t-shirt open, I think he wearin' a wire
I got some beef to wrinkle out, I'll go and grab the iron
[Verse 2: GrindHard E]
Everything I do be exotic shit, next, I might grab a tiger
Tell everybody, "You wanna see some crazy shit?" Set his ass on fire
I know a nigga had a baby'd catch a body for a pack of diapers
For twenty thousand, go arrange his funеral, they all comin' behind you
Sale triеd to come and get some weed to smoke before he worked, that shit got him fired
Opened up a 'bow bag of the 'za and I just got new buyers
Burned up the Scat Pack doin' donuts and we just— alright
Burned up the Scat Pack doin' donuts and we just got new tires
[Verse 3: Prince Jefe]
Bitch, I'm smokin' Gumbo
One band, one sound, I looked up and heard the drumroll
You gon' have to send an invoice, it's just one more
I'd rather go blind, I can't see 'em through this gun smoke
Five lines, when they ring, I know what they want
Clearin' BoAs, it's a dub, she walk out the door
Monkey on my back, this ain't no BAPE, I'm tryna poke
Cut the block and box him in, he ain't got nowhere to go
