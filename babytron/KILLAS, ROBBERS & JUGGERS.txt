[Intro]
Nyah, nyah, hey
ShittyBoyz
Mm, hmm, hey (
Don't you know you won the lotto?
)
[Verse 1]
Hit it with some xyla', boy, this shit'll drop a hippo
Presidential tinted, you would think the pop a limo
Why you talkin' pape' and you ain't never shopped on Zillow?
Snuck a trey through TSA, I should've copped a pillow
I bet Don bring her out her shell like an armadillo
We some sea creatures, we'll turn some sharks to minnows
Hundred on me, lookin' for the drank, I need a case
I got a hundred for some Perc' 10s, shit, I need like eight
Nowadays it's Spectres, pandemic, it'd be i8's
Everybody got a time, I know I gotta see my day
Askin' all thеse questions, shit, I think doggy CIA
Walk him down, pull my mask up, I let him see my facе
Poker face and tag too, five AK, let him see my hands
You damn near still ain't finished puberty, you still ain't seen nine bands?
Huh, why he tryna be Militia? He can't be my mans
If I don't pull the Mike Amiris down, this bitch gon' eat my pants
Sandstorm paintjob, the seats butter pecan
Bill Laimbeer, pop out, a dub in each hand
Lil' bro burnt out, got a gun in each hand
You better hope he don't blank, he get ugly off Xans
You would think that unc' on vaca', stompin' in the sand
You would think it's homecoming, get to drumming like a band
When it come to pape', ain't nothin' more important than the profit
