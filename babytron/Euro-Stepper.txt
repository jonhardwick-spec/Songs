[Intro]
Yeah, huh, bitch (
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
[Chorus]
Off-White, Heron Preston, looking like the dope man
Unky on the block making fiends hit the coke dance
It's 2021, we shoot guns, we don't throw hands
Tryna look cool, taking pics, them your bro bands
Off-White, Heron Preston, came through looking European
Hopping out the ship, copping drip, drove the 'Vert to Neiman'
s
Did the dash home and switched the whips just to skrrt the Demon
Looking like an angel, popping thirty, she a Perky demon
[Verse]
Bitch walking out the pharm' with some V-cuts
I don't sell shit, bro and thеm had to re-up
Two charms out of Hutch, both piece bust
Lеt them fuckers try to flick me, I'ma make 'em eat dust
Huh, huh, y'all can't keep up
It was cream, but I turned it to a pink Crush
Free meals in school, now it's lobster when I eat lunch
Talking money, never made the money counter beep once
2017, you probably caught me at the Western Union
Caught an opp and beat on him like he Metro Boomin
Thought that he was tripping in the club, I took a check and threw it
Tried to have a money war, was looking extra stupid
Riding in the Demon sticked up, might need an exorcism
Walking by and not saying shit would be your best decision
Doggy said I'm broke, well, his 'Wood must have meth up in it
Fuck 20/20, for the pape', I got some better vision
Fuck 2020, bitch, this whip a 2021
Straight to the league, back then, I would've one-and-done
Three-five of Runtz, goddamn, I'm fucking up my lungs
Alright, here we go
Thousand dollar jean rocker, Mike Amiris on
Woke up and made ten, you was eating Cheerios
Finna get lost, what the fuck is Siri on?
Four of Aunt Jemima in my system got me steering slow
Huh, I can't talk right, I can't walk straight
Know you see these bangs, .223s give 'em a bald fade
Tripping in the big body fucker tryna hog lanes
I'll pull this bitch from half court while I call game
Huh, to be a hundred, I'm a dog, boo
Huh, to be a thousand, I'ma dog you
Drive fast, dress flexy, bitch, and I talk rude
BabyTron, nowadays I'm only making boss moves
Yeah, I heard about you, you a pillow talking cornball
Get your ass out of Somerset, you can't afford drawers (Sheesh)
Can't relate, shopping day, this my fourth mall
(Sheesh)
Hear me roaring in the 'Hawk when I soar off
Let me tell you something, I can't be fucked with
Let me tell you something, gang 'nem up shit
Let me tell you something, got your bitch here to suck dick
Fully bust kit, hell nah, I ain't gon' tuck shit
One of one, hit the clerk with a one dip
BIN Reaper, swear to God that all these dumps hit
SB, DSM, bitch, we on that one shit
White sticks like they came out some Fun Dip
Up now, so my phone twerking
Unky in the mountains, out of town where it's slow service
I'm the GOAT and I'm so certain
Fucked up 'cause your life fun, don't do no workingYou don't even pay bills, you not a grown man
How is you a rapper? Cut it out, you ain't got no fans
Bitch better stare at this kit 'cause I don't dance
How you got fire CVVs? Don't even know Stan
