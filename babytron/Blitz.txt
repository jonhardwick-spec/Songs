[Intro: BabyTron]
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, long live $cam
Hey, hey, ayy (
Meech
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Gen5 with the glitch
It ain't a single SI in my kit
Buffed up, spent a dime on the sticks
Shit, I'm stingy with my drank, can't lend a line of the Tris
That shit equals money, you be spendin' time with the bitch?
Why you in the kitchen? Can't even stretch a five to a six
Was the first to up it, shit, I felt the vibe when it switched
Show 'em that the field real, they televisin' the blitz
[Verse 2: Baby Ghost]
Free Da Yung OG
I can't tell who on my side, gotta watch my back
Bitch tried to set the play, now she gotta watch her back
No DVD, we be gettin' niggas smacked
She just got her hair done, she said don't grab her tracks, but I'm still gon' do it
Bro keep tellin' me don't do it, but I'm still gon' shoot it
I be beatin' bitches with belts, I think I'm Pootie
Shot a nigga in his head, I think he pooted
Off two Percs and some Trish, I'm in this bitch droolin'
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Mixed the Addies with the shrooms, I'm in this bitch zooted
Dropped a deuce of the juice, I'm in this bitch snoozin'
TRX, I'll throw that bitch in launch, I'm in this bitch cruisin'
One me, three buttons, shit, I'm in this bitch coolin'
I think it's time to give the doggy charm a big Cuban
Eurosteppin', shootin', you can't even tell I quit hoopin'
She done threw up off the V-cuts, the Lyft ruined
Really duckin' wreck, you just sittin' at the crib boostin'
It's just me and Baby Ghost
Blowin' opps out the 'bow, this ain't eighthy smoke
Bust down my Audemars
You don't even wanna know the price, it damn near cost an arm
Slidin' down this block with some jewelry on, be done lost a charm
Fuck off top, I don't think, this shit off the heart
Tax terrorist, I bet he ain't gon' ball 'til March
All the pieces came together, hope that they don't fall apart
