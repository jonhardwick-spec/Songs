[Intro]
(
Jax sent it to 'em
)
Biggest of the biggest, yeah
Rich nigga lifestyle
[Chorus: FMB DZ]
I could show you how to level up
I'm on Rodeo in a foreign with the bezel bust
Thick Cubanas, dropped two Fantas
Walk in Amiri with Amiri on, they think I'm scammin'
I'm offended, I'ma go to Louis just to spend a bag
Sent me champagne, I don't drink, so I sent it back
Rich nigga, want the newest drip I see on the rack
Gotta buy it twice, you know me and baby like to match
[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
Once she see the spaceship, I know she goin'
Dior everything, I ain't feelin' Rick Owens
'Sace, Balenci, Porsche follow bеhind the Bentley
It's a lifеstyle, we don't do it 'cause it's trendy
A lot of niggas goofies, a lot of bitches groupies
S-Class Benz sittin' outside and it's a hoopty
Go to war for my respect, nigga, shoot me or salute me
Nigga want some cavities, it's two thousand for a cutie
Nigga say he want some drank, I ain't sell him, take a hike
Oh, you wanna drink it with me? Pull up on me, bring a Sprite
My Texas niggas told me I ain't sippin' right with no ice
I can't relate, 'cause every time I take a sip it give me life
I don't do the buffs, but when I did, my shit was white as rice
How the fuck you tryna give a rich nigga some advice?
Top down all summer, tell 'em catch me at the light
Courtside all season, on the wood like I'm Spike
Nigga, I be where the money at, I like to thumb through it
I heard you had the drop on your opps and ain't do nothin' to 'em
Every time a car spint our block, we sent somethin' through it
Shoutout to my lawyer and my realtor, they both Jewish (Woop)
