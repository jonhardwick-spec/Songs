[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Off-White striped sweater, lookin' like I'm SpongeBob (Brr)
Turnt now, fucked around and cranked that one knob
Shout-out gang, some shoot, some scam, some rob
In Heron Preston sellin' food, it's a lunch line
Brodie off a bar, don't get blew when it's crunch time (Fuck)
Swervin' off the Wockiana, I don't drunk drive (Shit)
I'm tryna have a pistol fight, I'm finna up mine (Damn)
Mirror tint up on the Cartis for the sunshine
Dog $hit Militia, gang know I'm on the frontline
Pourin' up in my Moutain Dew while I'm in here counting blues
Livin' like Tom Cruise, see an opp, I'm hopping out the coupe
I just gotta let my chain dance, she gon' put that mouth to use
Penthouse MIA at the Fontainebleau
I was out workin', bro and 'em was out lurkin'
Was jumping out of Strikers, now I'm jumpin', crowd surfin'
Shit, I'm jumpin' out of Germans, this a i8 (Skrrt)
Drip God, throw this shit on, then I fly away
In here popping Perkys like I'm tryna fight a migraine
Cuddy in here serving glass, he pull it out the ice tray
Got it off the hustle, off the muscle, I ain't buy fame
Feelin' like Sub-Zero, masked up in these ice chains
R.I.P. Hutch
, kit bust
Ridin' in a foreign sticked up, switched up
Been a while since I been down 'cause I been up
Four grams of the runtz, only roll up big blunts
Look, I don't got a stutter problem when I talk wet
Would've thought I came from Niketown, I got all checks
Better call next, we got now, get the ball checked
7.62s, if they hit, they takin' off flesh (Brr), damn
