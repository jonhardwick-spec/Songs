[Intro]
7AM looking for biscotti, finna wake and bake
7 in the morning, we still open like a Steak 'n Shake
Ayy
[Verse 1]
Middle of the night in his grass tryna snake a snake
Shit im tryna break the bank, I'm off a eight of drank
25/8, we dangerous, you better play it safe
I wake up tryna run a check up, gotta stay in shape
You wake up mad, than a motherfucker
No money, bout as sad, as a motherfucker
And my bitch, she is bad, as a motherfucker
Another play, so you gotta add another number
Plugged in, I get gumbo for the low, buy the bowl
MIA, I'm just thinking "penthouse?, buy a boat?"
We'll treat the glitch like a Kleenex, wipe his nose
Fore' I cut the flash on, tell his ass, "strike a pose"
Opps need to do lashes, they just whine like some hoes
I just got the, uh-, t-, time to go
If you don't, then you don't, but I think it's time to know
I heard shh-, bag going, time to load
I get 50 every one, shit, I got time for shows
I did 20 in a row, do the math
I'mma call you 3rd man, you couldn't even do the half
Unky think he birdman, young money, cash money
Know I get it one day, before I ever had money
It could be blood on it, "what the fuck is bad money?"
This that vroom, zoom, skrt, m-, fast money
"You know to talk about it?, you gotta have money right"
7/50 all 50's, shit, let's have a money fight
You broke, as a joke, live the funny life
I'll put that hoe on the poll, if the money right
I'll put that hoe on the road, if the money doublin'
Zip bag season, you can catch me in my duffy hustlin'
You might catch anywhere, at any time
"How you think you in the loop?, you ain't got any ties"
Started with a 6, I added 3, bitch this a heavy sprite
Guarantee, I still ain't see what happen, if they tell me "life"
