(
You're not making this easy, Kyle

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Me and your bitch dropped a tape, but we wasn't in the booth
He done said the wrong shit, now his cousin in a suit
Turkey had a litter, in the kitchen fuckin' with the—
Treat her like these Ksubis, send her down the way and stuff her with some blues
We ain't talkin' 'bout doublin' up, I'm chuckin' up my deuce
R.I.P. 72, all this pain, guzzlin' my juice
On the wild West, gun slingin', hit Hubbell and vroom
Clocked in, activatеd, I'm stuck in that mood
I can get a bucket eithеr way, should I dunk it or shoot?
Karo'd 'em, when that shit hit the stomach, it's through
Would've got smushed back then, we was thuggin' in school
Grand Wagoneer, boy, you think you shittin' in a Honda?
French designer on, I'm ballin', Victor Wembanyama
Treat my jeans like a shawarma, stuffin' chicken in my Yamas (Ah)
So much Wock', I gotta sip it in pajamas, shit
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Come through with that thunder, shit, I feel like Chet (Grrah)
She see what's on my neck, so she gon' give me neck (Give me neck)
Shooter never miss, I swear his jumper wet (Fah, fah, fah)
Drinkin' Casamigos on a private jet (Shit)
Hit it like I love her, then I play her like a game
Tried to tell this lil' bitch she wasn't fuckin' with no lame (Mm-mm)
One hit'll knock you out, bitch, this a different type of strain (Phew)
Heard dog crashed out, he should've stayed in his lane (Skrrt)
Ridin' with a stick (Ayy) and a pretty ho (Okay)
If she don't suck no dick, that lil' bitch gotta go (Hop off)
My opp been catchin' bullets, didn't know that I can throw (Fah, fah)
Why when you get some fame, everybody call you bro? (Fuck on, bro)
Ooh, shit, ShittyBoyz back at it (Ha, ha, ha)
Like the hockey team, sticked up, it might get tragic
I've been ballin' on 'em for a minute, got a big habit
These niggas cannot fuck with me, might just get tatted
