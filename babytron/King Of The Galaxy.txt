[Verse 1]
High as hell moonwalking, Smooth CriminalHa-ha-ha, nah, for real, I feel like Mike Jack
So much money in my jeans, bitch, the blues visible
Huh, bitch, we call that shit a "thigh pad"
Rap star, shit, I'm feeling like I'm Polo G
Got a pole on me in a thousand dollar Polo tee
Bro scored (Shit), thank God wasn't no more lean
Dropping red in my pop, I don't pour no green
[Verse 2]
What the fuck is that? (What the fuck?)
Unky in the trap with oranges like a pumpkin patch (Shit)
Up the strap and double back, I'm laying something flat
Getting work out like a gym teacher (Burr), it's like jumping jacks (Shit, damn)
[Verse 3]
I got two sticks, alright
Two sticks, twenty-one, we'll blow him out
Moose Knuckles, Goose, or the 'Cler when it's snowing out (Shit)
That's some Tris? Better pour it out
Twenty Hellcats when we rolling out
Big dog shit, blues on me, I'm just showin' out
Had to blow dawg down, heard that he stole an ounce
