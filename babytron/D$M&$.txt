Up late thinkin' 'bout the pape', shit, I can't sleep
Blew his cap back, now they think he play for KC
Hot as hell, spent a couple nights 'cause your state green
Hot as hell, cuddy out of town sellin' fake beans
[Verse 2: MJPAID &
StanWill
]
This shit goin', got some sauce I'ma gatekeep
Can't help me make no pape', that's a bitch that I can't keep
Blew a KD for my wrist to say API can stomp an opp and run it up with the same feet
[Verse 3: Fordio &
BabyTron
]
I can write a slip or killer card with the same BIN
I done took Ls to the chin, just remain ten
Me and gang'll let our sticks fire like some cavemenBoy, don't еven ask about a verse unlеss the pape' sent
[Verse 4: MJPAID]
It's gettin' burnt up, don't let her see that same whip
In the Bay, I was noddin' on the stage, had to blame Trish
How the fuck I make twenty with the same glitch?
Sixty blues in my pocket, I don't bang Crip
