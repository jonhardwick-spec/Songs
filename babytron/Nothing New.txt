Huh, ayy
Undefined

Ayy, what up, Rob?
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz, ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
It's fucked up that I don't fear death
RIP Chris, I ain't even shed a tear yet
When I try and do right, I steer left
Big black chop on my side, Rob Dyrdek
Huh, lil' bitch knew the principles
I used to think that my heart was invincible
But, nah, I see that bitch just invisible
I just got a heaven-sent BIN, on the biblical
Thrust God, good Amiris, boy, my drip tremendous
I can slide twenty GCs in fifty seconds
I just shock the clerk, I guess this bin electric
Playing with that metal, let it rip like Jimi Hendrix
Real ShittyBoy like I'm in the restroom
Bet that bitch jaw drop when we step through
Had yo bitch sneak the head like she collect shoes
Finna come lab chain, diamonds on the test tube
