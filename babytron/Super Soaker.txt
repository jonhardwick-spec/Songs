Lyrics from Snippet
[Verse]
...fences I done jumped
Can't even take it with you, fuck it, I'mma spend it cause I'm up (Jumped)
If I step in, pay respect, a legend in the cut
In that raptor, fucked around and wrapped it, bendin' in the trunk
I'mma make it every time, last second in the clutch (Clutch)
Dice game, finna roll a seven with the—, uhh (Uhh)
I been grindin' every day, you see the pendant with the chunks (Phew)
[?] sendin' somethin' new, send it with thе Runtz
He was walkin' to the store and еndt up in the trunk
It was not a super soaker when I drenched him with the pump (Brr)
Shit, fuck (Shit, fuck)
She don't know how to play her role, she gotta stay at home
Three hundred dollars on a plate of sushi and filet mignon (Yum)
I'm a dog, why this bitch tryna chase my bone? (Dog, what?)
Made twenty off the road, I only paid the toll (Toll)
Road runnin', lookin' for the coyote
Gettin' bougie with my diet, but I always like Coney
I ain't a crackhead, but best believe it's pipe on me
We gon' smack heads with some lead, we don't fight, homie
Better act dead when we slide, it's on sight, brodie
He was on my back...
