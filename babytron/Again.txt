[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy
We got an awful lot of [?]
ShittyBoyz
(
Woah, Kenny
)
Hey
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
We got an awful lot of everything, not just cough syrup
I done woke up in some bandos, would've never thought Europe
This shit was just local, now it's global
It's been a while since I had to worry 'bout a total, I'm antisocial
How you gon' slide? Ain't even mobile
Cuddy stretchin' work, he turned a circle to an oval
After California, man, it's [?] like I'm [?]
We'll bomb his block and turn his whole hood to Chernobyl (
Ooh
)
Another day, another dollar
Every day, it's on, wake up, another problem
I just got another threat so I bought another chopper
Finna count another check, time to add another comma (Ayy)
Wе can't argue, you still stayin' with your mama
They be stoopin' down
Evеrybody thought I'd fail, they lookin' stupid now
We the type to roll through, y'all the type to move around
Heard that I'm on fire, I don't never plan on coolin' down
