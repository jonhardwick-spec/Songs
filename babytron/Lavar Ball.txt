Damn, JakeSand

Disrespectful as hell, for real

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Pissin' with the door open while I'm at your bitch house
When I walk up in the living room, I kick the kids out
Scammer to a rapper, had to fuck around and switch routes
Miles Bridges, when I hear it's up, I got big bounce, huh
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Ball so much, it should be my last name (Lavar)
Telescope on it, I ain't shootin' at the stars
You know your shit a bucket, can't be vroomin' in that car
Hutch did the jewelry, got her droolin' off the charm
Sloppy roll, got the Ksubis lookin like a Garda truck
When I'm in the iso, boy, it's hard to guard me up
Face card hot, I walk in and turn the party up
You won't catch me in the weight room, but my Cartis buff
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
You won't catch me, nah, you probably will catch me in the bank
Dickhead, catch the dub and hold the L up in his face
You trappin' two 'bows, unky sell it in a day
Rap star, might catch me in the hood with felons sippin' drank
Luka Trončić, Sleeve Nash, I'ma change the game
I ain't postin' up off the Wocky when I fade away
Made some shit today, you livin' day-to-day
Bin Master, Punch God, I damn near got a database
