[Part I]
[Intro]
(Enrgy made this one)
[Verse 1]
Who am I? The Prince of the Mitten
It's some dog food on that silverware, rinse off the dishes
Me and you two different guys, you out here simping 'bout the bitches
Drum hold some pocket change, I knocked the lint up out his denim
On his roof in all black, I hit his crib just like I'm Venom
He ain't had a run since forever, tryna find momentum
He ain't dropping, doggy-laced forever, we just micro-fent' him
We ain't doing plain jane gold, you gotta ice your pendant
We ain't toting sticks for no reason, gotta shoot your weapon
Fuck around and lose both his feet, he too new to stepping
Fogo De' ain't open today, had to go in Bucharest
Finna leave the country, I might fuck around in Budapest
Seven-different-color Marni hoodie, this bitch too majestic
If you catch a body then you snitch, you gon' lose the credit
I can do the credit, I can do the debit, this ain't new
Ninety percent of the grapevine, man, that shit ain't true
Prices fluctuated, ain't the same ticket as yesterday
Talking 'bout he in his bag only when he eat Better Made
I can only thank God, I guess that these the better days
Shit, I always come first like the letter A
