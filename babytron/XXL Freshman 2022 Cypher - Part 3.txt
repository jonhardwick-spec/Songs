[Intro: Future]
Wheezy outta here
[Verse 1: Kali]
They say they like how a bitch talk
Scared I'ma talk to their nigga like this
I did my last nigga so wrong
After he dropped like fifty on the wrist
Same nigga speak on my pussyAin't been in there since they came out
Same bitches speak on my verses
Ain't made a hit since they came out
Ain't it funny how life go?
I done went up, they went psycho
Say twenty-four, did you try, ho?
Every concert is a light show
Bitch, play with me, you goin' viral
If it's up, then it's stuck, on the rival
Make a bitch dance like a recital
Double back, I don't recycle
Like I'm Future, I never liked ya
I like bitches, but I'll never wife ya
Niggas only hard to they homeboys
Niggas only hard to they weak-ass bitch
Flashin' them guns in them videos
And don't even know how to load up the switch
I ain't even having no sneaky link
'Cause a nigga gon' brag on this shit
I thought he don't eat pussy
'Cause he feignin' to get him a lick (
Wheezy outta here
)
And I remember bitches is bullies
Now they asking me how I got rich, Kali
