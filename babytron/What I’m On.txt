[Chorus: Lawsy]
This that
top shelf
shit, you can't hit this blunt (Hit this blunt)
I got bitches all across the globe tryna fuck (Tryna fuck)
Grown bitches only thing that I want (That I want)
Junkie loving life, I sold him what he on (What he on)
This that Sexxnb shit, you ain't on what I'm on
This that top shelf shit, you can't hit this blunt (Hit this blunt)
I got bitches all across the globe tryna fuck (Tryna fuck)
Grown bitches only thing that I want (That I want)
Junkie loving life, I sold him what he on (What he on)
This that Sexxnb shit, you ain't on what I'm on
[Verse 1: Lawsy]
I got bitches in this crib, they gon' take off they thongs (Damn)
And I'm with this white ho sniffin' Adderall (Adderall, bitch)
Damn right, bitch, all we do is ball
When I'm tryna fuck, it just take one call (Boom)
Too many options, man, I swear I can't pick (I can't pick)
I keep scorin' meds, doctor think I'm hella sick (Hella sick)
If you talkin' 'bout that money, bitch, you bet I'm listening (Bet I'm listening)
I walk in the club with a stick, bitch, I'ma bring it in
I serve packs when I'm bored, that's just what I do (What I do)
Like a plumber, bitch, you know we bringin' in hella tools
The Glock with a switch? Or the Drac'? What do I choose? (What do I choose?)
Bruh tweaked out off the Fent', he can't move
