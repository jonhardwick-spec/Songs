[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Helluva made this beat, baby
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bags underneath my eyes, bitch, I need sleepBut I'm out of town jamming till I hear a beep-beep
Scoring now, feel like Shaq with the 3P
In the stu' with Helly, nah, boy, fuck yo free beat
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Fireman on my ass 'cause I keep heat
Put your dusty-ass fits down, fuck a three piece
Squaring up? I'll send you where the priests be
Reaching for the balls? Bitch a freak-freak
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Told that bitch give me space, I need three feet
Your whole team full of perping niggas that be three deep
She mad, I'm just tryna hit her like a DE
To be a hunnid, I'ma spin her ass like a CD
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Tryna wrestle? I ain't Randy Orton though
We walk around with movie clips, we the Warner Bros
I brought that bitch in and out like a corner store
Foreign ho sucked the whole dick, fuck a boring ho
