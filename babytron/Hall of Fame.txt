[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bitch, induct me to the Hall of Fame
MVP, you third string, we don't ball the same
Play with me? Baby Drac', it's gon' pause the game
He blew all that free pape', now he gotta pawn his chain
I'm in that one mode, all I done is tweak lately
Jack catching in the [?] daily
Y-3 joggy but my feet Yeezy 380s
I don't like how the eighthy look, told him re-weigh me
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Okay, pull up on a block, guess I been feeling like Kareem lately
Back to back plays, a couple L's what you seen lately
I won't break yo heart, I'm really tryna break yo spleen, baby
I'm a ShittyBoy but it ain't easy as it seems, baby
Okay, got a new Glock, messy eater, I'ma catch a stain
Niggas wanna shine but nеw edition, they can't stand the rain
Wе don't tuck tails, wet clothes, we'll let 'em hang
You don't really want it? You supposed to pass just like the gang
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Six hunnid dollar double cup, I can't stay awake
Fishtailing in the widebody with the paper plates
If you ain't in the game, sit there and let the players play
Blood on the Drac', bro had to throw the K away
Lay it up or shoot a three, I hit my shot from any spot
10K or more when I'm in Saks, we don't petty shop
Yo bitch opened up her water park, I almost belly-flopped
Talking 'bout he on his way to slide? Shit, I bet he not
