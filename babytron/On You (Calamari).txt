[Verse 1]
He always hattin' call 'em [?]
I'm so far from that fucker, i can't see the grid
Plug pulled up steppin' on the line i can peep the mid (Huh, Yeah, That's a two)
Talking over Calamari with the source, for you simpletants we eatin' squid
Mister Wocky in my cup how dark it is you think it's [?]
[?] sits around my house, I got a genius crib
He ain't eatin' I can see his ribs someone come feed they kid
Had a small chance to make it work but I was dreaming big
Unky makin' Pros off the Maxes we ain't bringing Sims
Thinkin' y'all done built a bond whole time they tryna' bail on you
Thinkin' that they tryna' ride the ship whole time they tryna' sail on you
Back against the wall I bet I'll put a nail on you
Bet i'll make it rain, snow, sleet and make it hail on you
Actin' like you moving work ain't got a hunnid sales on you
Actin' like you moving work ain't got a scale on you?
I'm living good, rich now, gon' ball like Gail on you
Sad story, ended up in jail he's had him tell on you
You can't be in the Militia, don't fit the criteria
Moving round' like ISIS, Swear to God the block like Syria
Got a Proxy doin' magic, Loco in Liberia
Once I make a fifty here gon' squish it to Nigeria
Got a sweet tooth Vanilla-
