[Intro]
(
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Play I just made won't make SportsCenter
I don't fight girls but I'm a whore hitter
Niggas start to see you win and act so bitter
Can't join a team unless you a for sure shitter
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Glock hit him like it's Ed Reed but it ain't got a safety
SBs cost a touchdown, you still shop at Macy's
Want a verse? It's a max contract you gotta pay me
Slide down and play bully ball, shit, we got a baby
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Hand gang coordinate the blitz, he'll sack around
Treat your bitch like a warmup, she got passed around
5.45s in the K, this a faster round
Jason Voorhees, boy, your bitch let me stab her down
[Verse 4: TrDee]
You ain't never gon' win like Dak Prescott
Chain really dance, it's getting sturdy like it's Kay Flock
Only rule when applying pressure is you can't stop
You the type of nigga, hit the mall but do not shop
