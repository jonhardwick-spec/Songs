Lyrics from Snippet
[Verse]
...I'm feignin'
We just scored, poured a three, now I'm dreamin'
Why you ain't rich if you think like a genius?
Throwin' bread, been a beast since a fetus
Shroom [?] third piece, shit, I'm geekin'
You took that freak out the E? Oh, you tweakin
She got a man so she sneak when we linkin'
In the booth, bet I preach like a deacon
Had to wipe my eyes, do you see what I'm seein'?
If you heard what I heard, you would be pissed
Bitch urked my last nerve, get off my meat stick
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (Hmm)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (Skrrt)
I'm in first, first, first, first, grabbin' silver medals
I'm in first, skrrt, first, first, tryna kill the pedal
I was dancin' with the [], thank the angels on my shoulder
You won't make it out alive, bitch, [?], Glocky in the holster
Pull up, brodie catchin' bodies, Blake Griffy with the poster
Cuddy in the mountains, finna put up fifty, like the Joker
It get tricky on the road, like, which choice should I go?
Quagey-Agey, Stilpane, Wock', like, what should I pour?
You the Chris Middleton with the plays, bitch, I'm Giannis
That little shit you on, I'm beyond it
Two-hand twist time, lil' bitch...
