[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Shoot to Cali', shoot back, then it's to the stu'
Doggy working shifts back-to-back, he on a two-to-two
Thinking that he charged up, we pulled up and we blew his fuel
Wouldn't dare cuff that lil' bitch, that ho super through
We can't beef if I can't Google you
Why you think we brought chopsticks? We came to noodle you
Dicksucking in the comments, hit 'em with the, "Who is you?"
Widebody Hellcat, this fucker came with super zoom
You won't catch me, hit the brakes
But, you might catch me up in Fleming's getting steak
Checks ATM, bank zipped, I'm just getting paid
Finna drop the buffs for 4K and never lift a weight
I'ma send him up to God whеre he lifts his gates
If a sack on your hеad, we gon' blitz with K's
Thirty-two shots, mask on tryna rip his face
Threw my bitch a light thirty ball and told her, "Fix her face"
[Verse 2: Mondo Jackson]
I gave the ho a Perc' 30, told her, "Fix her face"
I hit him with the whole .30, can't see his face
I got bruh [?] in the wrong place
He on [?], so one, he'll take chains
I heard you FBI and you cool with jakes
I'm cool with slime balls and I chill with the snakes
Medusa all my Glocks, told you that I like snakes
And I just beat a case
Shell catcher, yeah, I love 'em .38's
Mailman, moving shit state to state
Dead man, huge sleep every wait
