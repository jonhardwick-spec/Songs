[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Ayy, Clover, what up?
)
Turn his block into Nuketown
I'll turn his block into Nuketown
Ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Turn his block into Nuketown
Choppa with the muzzle make the poof sound
Benz looking like a UFO with the roof down
Flying off the Runtz, grab yo bitch when I swoop down
I'm the truth now but you knew that
"Who that?", bitch, it's BabyTron, with yo through-ass
I ain't gon' lie, yo capping-ass should wear two hats
I'm feeling like The Punisher, I'm riding 'round with two straps
[Verse 2: Brooks]
Yeah
Brooks [?] wake up with yo ho
If she ain't tryna fuck then the bitch gotta go
Pulling up to the White House with a heavy load
[?] the rubber for the [?] something you gotta know
Is you perping or you working? Nigga, tell me what you sold
Loving all on that bitch, I'll still do her bold
Tryna book me for a show? Need a thousand on the nose
Test run, get a thousand of th–µm bitches sold
