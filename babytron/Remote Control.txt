[Verse 1]
The plates West Coast Customs
Mister Earn-It-All, you'll probably ask to hold somethin'
Thousand 101s, thousand beans got the road jumpin' (Shit)
I don't need shit but I want more hundreds (Brrt)
Treat it like a king, you livin' like a peasant
Out here telling on yo' mans? You ain't gon' die respected
Twenty-eight, gettin' bullied, boy, it's time to buy a weapon
I done did the Scat, 'Cat, 'Hawk, 'Vette, I might try a Lexus
What I paid for the juice, can only find in Texas (Ah)
What I paid for the shoes, you tryna save up (Ooh)
Shit, I'm finna get rich, my mind made up
It's 2022, cut it out with the same stuff
Ain't you getting borеd? (Ooh)
Got yo' bitch tapping out off the figure four (Brrt)
Finna hit the billboard, Mark hit rеcord
Saks workers call me "Drip Lord" when I'm in the store
Told 'em I was finna blow
Shit, I detonated
Do you see a crease? I only step the latest
Do you see the tee? I'm a
rude
fuck
My pop flat, I need a new Crush to pour this deuce up (Shit)
You said you gon' do what? (What?)
You seen yo' opps a hundred times, ain't shoot once (Lame)
You rolled a thousand 'Woods, ain't never blew runtz (Lame)
Oh, you on a budget
Stop it with the monkey talk before I take a roll and up it (Brrt)
Shit, we know we all that, Kenan & Kel (Shit)
Doin' fraud, VPN, it ain't leaving a trail (Nope)
Keep it on me, fuck a grave, rather be in a cell
Robbers in yo' crib while you sleep, they ain't ringing the bell
