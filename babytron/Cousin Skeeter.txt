[Verse: BabyTron]
Paranoid, I thought the pizza man was a cherry top
Probably would've hit your target, but you took a scary shot
Hutch diamonds on me, I ain't never seen a Gary box
Ahki with habibi finna slide and try to bury opps
Microwave, I get hot quicker than Vinnie Johnson
Chop with double D's, it need a bra, it got some titties on it
Nah, for real, Zack Randolph, put a fifty on it
Back in 2020, every 'fit, I spent a stimmy on it
Three-five after three-five, I'm beyond blowed
Scam God, I pulled some shit off that only God knows
The bandwagon takin' off, you better hop on
Buffs on, off a four of Wocky so the pop strong
I'm online fuckin' everything up like Cousin Skeeter
Unky, he a drankhead, he pouring up another liter
Balenciaga shopping, spеnd a band on some running sneakers
Back in high school, had еnough thrust to fuck the teachers
Huh, 'fit five thousand, I'm just chillin', though
Huh, off a V-cut, charging up like Piccolo
Huh, damn near forty in these 'Miris, bitch, I'm pigeon-toed
Huh, I'm outta town riding, so you know the ceiling gone
Huh, I'm in my zone, in that one mode
He was talking crazy, pop up on him with a snubnose
Hoes breaking necks 'cause I'm walking through the club froze
Better turn me off, you lookin' for a love song
Grind mode, all twenty-four, seven days a week
Talk about some za, but you out here selling eighths for cheap
Trackhawk, you gon' break your neck tryna race the Jeep
Never lost with this rap shit, I ain't face defeat
Sky Priority, my luggage got the yellow tag
Put a band on an opp head, he look like Melo ass
Can't afford 'Woods, you in the crib rolling 'rillos mad
On Saks, finna hit the site with a Canelo jab
It's 2021, might make a hundred off an NFT
Touchin' down right by Ford Field, this ain't the NFC
Thought that I was human, I'm a G.O.A.T. is what they telling me
Pull up with a AR with more legs than a centipede
Splash God, bitch, I'm drippin' like the Seven Seas
Glocky with the switch got more kick than a special team
Why you talkin' down like you ahead of me?
Throw a jab and I'ma throw some hollows, pussy, wrestle these
Scam star, I done turned into a rap star
Wounds left from the battlefield, shit, my back scarred
Before the booth, all I really knew was crack cards
Know some motherfuckers hate fraud, but they trap hard
Know some motherfuckers showin' love, but it's hate inside
You gon' get left in the middle, out here playing sides
Took the Mitten's rap scene and I made it mine
Done wrestling with these 'Miri jeans, shit, it's Franklin time
