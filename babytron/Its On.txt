[Intro: BabyTron]
Alright, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, it's on, it's on
Ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Granny mad as hell, she talking 'bout I buy too many clothes
Stan, I think we need a U-Haul, bro, it's too many phones
It's only two bands here, I'm thinking it's too many hoes
FedEx flagged the drop house, we sent too many loads
Think I got a problem, I don't think, I just pick my hoes
Dre stuck with some ice on, you would think he froze
Won't give my bitch a shit, probably think I'm broke
Stan got a shot like Gelo, well I think I'm Zo
[Verse 2: StanWill]
We on Melrose tripping, buying everything
Dre big tripping in the Scat, he in every lane
DOBs, SSNs, we got every name
Dirty in the rental, we got sticks, we got Mary Jane
Ayy, ShittyBoyz up, told my boys, "We the shit, gang"
Pulled the pape' out, left my jeans with some shit stains
Bitch irritating, I'm so glad that her Lyft came
Bitch, we play with Dracs like we running through the 6, gang
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
We'll put the hoes on him 'cause his brain in his dick, ayy
Bitch setting plays up, LJ came with the stick, ayy
You a stinky bum bitch with a pocket full of lint, lame
New i8, I shift drift then I switch lanes
Yeah, I'm skinny but the Glock'll put the muscle on you
Slime walking, Triple S, nine hunnid with the bubbles on it
Bro'll sauce you up for that and put the mustard on you
I'm finna punch some Air Max just so I can hover on 'em
