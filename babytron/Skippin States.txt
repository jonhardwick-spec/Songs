[Intro: StanWill]
(
The Don

Whew, huh
[Verse 1: StanWill]
I had to teach myself ain't nothin' fair in live
Skinny-ass Amiris only time you catch me wearin' Mikes
Bitch, Dog Shit Militia (
Jxckk just want a drink
)
If I see you with a rat, then y'all a pair of mice
Doggy said it's up, I hope that he don't think I'm scared of heights
Told your ho to give me space, bitch, I'm a terabyte
Funny I done made his boo go ghost, we had a scary night
Shit, it get spooky fast
Cuddy quick to pop an opp, the same shit that I do to tags
In that AMG, like BabyTron, I'm Mr. Do the Dash
Be done blew the brain up out a nigga, leave him stupid fast
I might lose faith in a ho, but you know I'll never lose the bag
Huh, no cap
[Verse 2: TrDee]
It was niggas prayin' on our downfall, I know they broke as fuck and mad (Where your money at?)
Watch when you ballin', niggas try to hack you
If my mans ever down, just know I'ma spot you
Niggas irritatin', like a pimple, I'ma pop you
You know the world really yours, ain't nobody got you
Whip came from America, my bitch foreign
I could have five fouls, I'ma keep scorin'
If she ain't got the two-hand twist, that bitch boring
My coat Moncler, it used to be Ralph Lauren
We gon' smoke him like a 'Wood if it's ever problems
All shooters in the hood, ain't nobody doctors
Lame bitches got broke niggas on they roster
Old ho call my phone, my bitch made me block her
