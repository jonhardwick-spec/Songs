You're not making this easy, Kyle
Bitch
Yeah
Huh, yeah
(Verse 1: BabyTron)
Amiri saggin’, I be walking round with heavy paper
Shooter get like Dame, he get to bustin' out the Chevy Blazer
She can't turn around from turning ’round cause I already paid her
I knew I win when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was optimistic
Burning hoes in the foreign, treat it like a Honda Civic
Titi fiendin', see a rock, she gotta get it
In Texas, play after play, I'm out here Popovichin'
Ain't no quali in my coffee cup, it's wock up in it
So much wocky in my cup, forgot it's pop up in it
5’7, put it down to show you that I got them bitches
When you was washing dishes, I was hopping fеnces
Why the fuck you in the mall if you ain’t shopping in it?
I could triplе up if I just put it in the pot and spin it
Talking 'bout he hitting buckets, I just watched him brick it
Throw dog on fakewatchbusta, all his watches are tickin’
(Verse 2: J1Hunnit)
Them bands got my pockets too fat, Fred (?)
We up enough to put an M on his head and turn to Majin
Me and brody talkin real spicy like Tajín
It's two hoes and one J1Hunnit, we ménagin'
I told 'em this an us thing, I don’t like monogamy
I'm riding behind 5 percent tint, the seats massaging me
The unemployment gone, this shit done fucked up the economy
The man with the method, I sell sauce but not the condiment
I'm almost out the game and the feeling is astonishing
The fans scream my name and they praising my accomplishments
I'm hard on a bitch, I don't ever give her compliments
I told her put the money in my hand, I wanna fondle it
I'm balling so hard, they wanna box me, Nate Robinson
Seen an opp and swung a chair at him like Jonathan
My plug charging 5 for the Eagle like Donovan
I told em we could get 10 for it if Unc' tumble it
