[Verse 1: BabyTron]
My whole work in the double, I got time to cheat
All I'm thinking hustle-hustle, I ain't got time to sleep
I just spent a double-double on a diamond link
Me and Beann, that's double trouble, caught a play, we flying east
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Up and racks on Ocean Drive
If it's money on the floor, bitch, you supposed to dive
Fuck I look like tossing ones when I be toting 9s?
I got two much ice up in my bezel, I don't know the time
I can make four in five
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Pull up with that spatula, fuck up a nigga barbecue
I can't tell you shit about the bitch, boy, this the starter crew
I hang with bartendеrs, fuck around and send some shots at you
I don't give a fuck about your gun bеcause I got one too
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Bounce out with that stick, I got a pogo with me
Buffs stay white, it's two percent, I'm smoking on some Cocoa Krispies
Six figures and up, we getting old, you better not post no fifty
Less you want the marshals on your head, little bro, don't post no switchy
[Verse 5: StanWill]
Foreign hoes, foreign clothes, niggas think I immigrated
Doggy talk to piggies, when it's war, might catch him in the station
Fuck a bitch, the Franklins only shit I'm chasin'
This a super rifle, if I shoot the floor, might hit an Asian
