[Intro: BabyTron]
(Helluva Beat, baby)
Ayy, turn that up a little bit
(
Smoke on the beat
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Look me in my eyes, nah, for real, it's some shit inside me
I ain’t going in the club unless the blicky by me
If I tell her what her friend did, this bitch gon' fight me
Nike tech on for a week, man, this shit so trifling
[Verse 2: Kasher Quon]
I told the lil' nigga it was a Perc’, it was a Vicodin
I'm in the studio freestyling, I ain't writing it
This Backwood keep going out, I keep lighting it
Amiri jeans on tight as hell with dog shit in 'em
[Verse 3: YSR Gramz]
Ka-Kasher just walked in with a Drac' taller than him
A nigga play one of us? I'm killing all of them
You a bitch, I heard you snitched on dog and them
I only wear shoes once 'cause I'm dogging ’еm
[Verse 4: Kasher Quon]
I don’t be cuffing on these hoеs, I be dogging 'em
You say you got white Runtz, why you stalling then?
You say you got a Hellcat, why you walking then?
This lil’ bitch said I'm broke, why you fuck me then?
