[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Road running, sinning with a Bible on the dash'
Brodie sliding off a Perc', got the rifle with the flash
Ayy, ayy, bitch, ayy
Dawg a lil' pup, have my bullies pick on him
What yo Glocky got? Mines got a fully switch on it
Told my bitch, "Roll the Runtz, don't let no Cookie get on it"
If the sneakers don't cost a band, the hoodie hit for it
Two liters, six of Wockiana, boy, this shit potion
Shouldn't have left me wide open, now I'm finna swish on 'em
Magician with the Visas, finna do a trick on 'em
Unky need a first place medal, swear his wrist golden
Where yo toughest gang member at? I'll big bro him
Mister Backdoor, you won't hear him, he be tip-toeing
How the fuck I'm on fire 'round this bitch? My kit frozen
We gon' leave him flopping on the floor, we catch him fish bowling
[Verse 2: TrDee &
BabyTron
]
Oh, they still sleeping? Wake 'em up just like a rumble strip
How the fuck you run off with a bag and you fumble it?
I ain't never really care for magic but I know a trick
Had his own wave and fell off, I know he sick
When we getting private, I'ma slam it, Lob City Blake
He prolly say our music ass 'cause he can't relate
We the top ten out the Mit', it ain't no debate
Can't believe you really still broke, it might be yo fate
Don't look when you see me out, might be with yo bitch
I ain't never have to see a mic, I still was getting rich
Fuck how she look when we done, I send her with a kick
