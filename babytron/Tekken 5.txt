[Intro: BabyTron]
Huh, yeah, bitch, huh, yeah
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I can't spill the sauce, they gon' run with the recipe
Ride around with demons, I don't know why God blessing me
Thousand dollar Nike SBs, you don't step in these
If it ain't pape' then you blocked, bitch, why you texting me?
Pull up, hit his top, now it's rest in peace
Boy, that's lead to yo head if you testing me
Tripping in the Mitten, next week it's Venice Beach
It's 2021, you should bust the play instead of leech
Hard body, stand tall like I'm Tacko Fall
He talked shit behind yo back, that is not yo dawg
Boy, you touch a hair on me? Bet a shot go off
Crunchy in thе booth, cheese on me, this that nacho talk
Backwood and cranberry Evеrfresh to clean my system
He jumped from the porch to the streets, we gon' leave him in 'em
They thought I drowned in the deep end, I know they peep me swimming
Amiri jeans, bitch, I drip sauce like a piece of chicken
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Where the cool clerks at? I'm tryna slide PS5
Baby pussy really knock me out, call it "Tekken 5"
He was just riding down the block, he ain't even slide
Getting to it 25/8, I ain't never tired
We'll drop numbers on his block just like it's number streets
We damn near the coldest group, how you ain't heard of me?
Huh, if balling was a crime, they'll murder me
Still ten toes when the Devil tried to corner me
Jab once, jab twice, told 'em not me
Like all my hoes' face pretty, head sloppy
I been running to the top like I'm Rocky
Know all my songs really fire like a Taki
I'm in the crib counting chicken, eating Mighty Wings
For a couple slips I bet she'd do a lot of things
He can't hit a note but I bet he'll let his choppa sing
He ain't got a car but he done went to Hutch and got some bling
