[Verse 1: BandGang Masoe]
Bitch, I'm on New Circle with two circles
Two straps, buffs on like I'm Steve Urkel
Draymond Green, a nigga play and I bet we gon' hurt him
Niggas love to put on shows 'til we close his curtains
I'm with BabyTron, blew a dime, nigga lost his mind
Glock 23 when I'm in LA, feel like LeBron
A switchy on that thing, watch it spit faster than Busta Rhymes
They don't want us in the function, we committin' crimes
[Verse 2: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
It's just me and mines, he play with us, that boy done waste his time
Been on the block thuggin' since DoughBoyz had "Grind 2 Shine"
They got a button on the back, that Glock was probably mine
And when them feds come around, I get too hard to find
Thеse niggas mustard, tell 'em catch up
Tеn-milli', that bitch automatic, it's goin' like a breast pump
I'm sick as hell with my double cup, I had to go get a check-up
This street shit get real, I'm in the field, nigga, come check up
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Ayy, it's just me, Mas, and Glock
Ride around with fah-fah-fah, we got three modded chops
Weapon plug got everything, he even keep Molotovs
You was him in 2020, ain't got three dollars now?
Shit, you ain't had no hustle, just a couple PUAs
When you really ballin', boy, the fans'll pay to see you play
Never goin' broke again, I understand Kentrell
Let us catch him noddin' off the turtle, we gon' crack his shell
