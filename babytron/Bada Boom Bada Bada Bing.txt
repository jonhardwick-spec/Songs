[Verse 1: TrDee]
Doing fifty in a thirty-five, riding to success
Hit a couple bumps, lonely nights made me wanna, yeah
Keep it going, they'll hear me
Doing fifty in a thirty-five, riding to success
Hit a couple bumps, lonely nights made me wanna flex
She don't got a bag, only thing she offer is some sex
He don't got a gram, he in the streets playing with a check
Baby, check me out, BBC, who the fuck is he?
Staring like he know me, put his stupid-ass on NBC
TBT, used to pray just for the EBT
Hoping that it come 'cause my stomach had my BAC
Who really got yo back?
'Cause these niggas rеally think they slicker than some slacks
Typе of shit that get you whack
Now you on a shirt, in a body bag, and a pack
#MiniMe, you can clearly see that these lil' niggas envy me
I'm the only Dee
What you think "Tr" stand for? I'm the real me
I'm like, "Baby, you know I stop, do you really feel me?"
Man, you niggas kill me
If she find out I'm cheating, she might Emmett Till me
Damn, she gon' try to kill me
Used to grind just for a band, now it's hunnid mill meal
Hunnid mil' just so I can go somewhere and chill
Kept it real, they should probably put me on a bill
Be for real, you ain't never went and got a kill
Bitch, I been a hustler, coach put me in just for a steal
