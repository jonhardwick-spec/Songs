It's Bluestrip, baby

Huh
[Verse 1: TrDee]
It's Thursday, I'm at the club only for the lamb
Are you a Action Replay? Then put her on the cam
I heard yo gang a bunch of burgers and yo bitch a ham
I don't even like this shirt, I bought it 'cause I can
Even with my glasses off I can see the fakes
They just wanna try to stop me, hate come with breaks
But I'ma live it up until I see the gates
Told him this what happened, I was hurt that they ain't have faith
She can't stay mad because I take her on a shopping spree
Something 'bout the fame always make the hoes flock to me
Said hеr head was fire, I was driving, had to stop and see
Opps good at catching 'cause I swеar they never dropping me
Timbs on, off the joggy they can tell I'm from the Mitt
Politicking 'bout some money, never beefing 'bout a bitch
Y'all can have the tough shit, I would rather get us rich
Got it off the hams, I ain't never had to sell a brick
I can't even leave the crib if it ain't about no cheese
I be running through that money, boy, that shit a breeze
If you play yo role right then you shall receive
A couple purses and some hair if you say please
I think I wanna paint yo face, baby, say cheese
I think a cop got behind us, baby, take these
God, fuck these fake niggas, why you make these?
Don't give yo heart to me, girl, I break these
