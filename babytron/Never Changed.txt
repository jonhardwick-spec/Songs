[Intro]
Ayy, J.K
ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1]
Fell in love with the rim, now I love the mic
Ran it up in the Loubs and knocked out a spike
Margiela stepping now, I had to put up the Mike's
I got a piece in my pocket that'll get you right
Shoot shit and I hit like I'm Doug McDermott
Tough times on my mind got my stomach hurting
Was down on my ass, bounced back like Kyrie Irving
You are not buffed up, man, please stop the perping
Thrusted up, I hit the road and then I turn around
You talking less than a band? I gotta turn it down
Ski mask rolled up, when I pull up, I'ma pull it down
Y'all niggas broke like the rim when Shaq pulled it down
Had a piece to hit the whole fucking spring break
Out here pushing buttons like I'm tryna make the screen shake
Bro got that dawg that'll make a fucking fiend shake
Why would we think the bell real if yo jeans fake?
[Hook]
Same niggas used to love me wanna hate now
They see me out and they say I'm acting fake now
I'm not fake, I'm just in love with the cake now
You won't see me out 'cause I'm going state to state now (
Ayy, J.K.
)
Riding in a Lexus, might crash 'cause I skate now
Finna eat good, hit up Beni's for the steak now
Used to be hungry but a nigga got a plate now
Don't look me in the eyes, I can see a snake now
