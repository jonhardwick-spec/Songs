[Intro]
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
Yeah (
I am the King
)
Finna go, yeah
I'm finna tear yo' lil'â€”, yeah
Finna tear yo' bitch (Ayy)
Man
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
Finna tear yo bitch walls down like a termite
Road running, this a checkpoint, hit the turnpike
Pull up on you for that cheese, I'm the big worm type
Shit talking white boy, I'm Cena with the word "life"
White Mountain Dew like King Buu, now I look like Kirby
Chicken on his head, watch that boy get cooked like turkey
First bird gets the worm, lil' bitch, I'm jugging early
Thinking that he shooting like he Curry, we done took his .30
In a Vert with a lil' Uzi, feel like Baby Pluto
I ain't high off the first 'Wood when I'm facing two more
Hmm, oh your buffs? Got 'em straight from kudos
One up ain't enough, we gon' slide and make it 2-0
Human Race with the green tag straight from StockX
Road run, punch jacks, and you know I drop checks
Real baller, I'll drop sixty and will not sweat
Sick of this lil' bitch, all she got is hot breath
Out the country, upping yin, on my tourist shit
When I touch down, it's MIA, good Florida trips
She don't put pape in my pocket? I ignore the bitch
Christian Dior, Louboutin, on my foreign drip
Board the plane, first class Delta if I board that bitch
I was looking for assists, now I'm on my scoring tip
I'ma let it blow if an opp looking towards my blick
Reach for this chain? A dude's gonna take a florist trip
Finna get some trop, my bitch on her Tim Hortons tip
Pocket got a knot, I get flashy when I'm bored and shit
Feel like Paul Revere, come through and I'm horsing shit
Pushing foreign shit, oh shit, you can't afford a Lyft?
This a scam house, finna get up on my order tip
But I can take you to the dope spot where they snorting shit
2K foot work, Virgil did the Jordan kicks
I can hear the bag talking to me, on my Dora tip
Real life shit talker, bitch, I drip water
I can turn the crowd up, spot jump like Vince Carter
How the fuck my pop look like Flint water?
Sometimes it ain't the plug, boy, you gotta switch chargers
Swear to God, really I'm just preaching in this bitch
Fucking racks up, walk out Neiman's leaving drip
Bitch named "Angel" and the demon doing dick
Going 160, I might make the Demon do a flip
