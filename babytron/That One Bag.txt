That's what bag you in, man?
Woo
Huh, yeah, ayy
Dumb ass nigga, huh
Don't get shot in your shit, drunk ass nigga, huh
Ayy
Huh
[Chorus: Cash Kidd]
Yeah, Maze made the beat, dumb ass nigga, huh
I got Guccis on my feet, bum ass nigga, ayy
Say she got a boyfriend, fuck that nigga, ayy
She gon' fuck 'cause I'm in that one bag, nigga, ayy
Maze made the beat, dumb ass nigga, ayy
I got Guccis on my feet, bum ass nigga, huh
Say she got a boyfriend, fuck that nigga, ayy
She gon' fuck 'cause I'm in that one bag, nigga, ayy
[Verse 1: Cash Kidd]
Real, real deep in that one bag
Told Mell don't shoot him, he said fuck that
Every time an opp die, we the suspects
If Ashton Kutcher ever punked me, I might up mag
Paranoid, split a nigga top like a Runtz pack
All my hoes leave 'cause I'm a dog, but they come back
Bitch, stop staring while you suckin', I'ma nut fast
Ridin' 'round with the whacker on me like I cut grass
Yeah, if you see me out, I brought the pole
Lost my buffs in a shootout, woke up, bought some more
Just got blew by a fan for so long, I caught a cold
Man, what the fuck I'm gon' do with all these hoes?
You know pimpin' ain't easy
Told my hitman, "I like the way you did that right there"
Bitch, I ain't Chingy
When I say I got my cake up, I ain't clingy
Just left a famous bitch on read, I ain't easy, bitch
