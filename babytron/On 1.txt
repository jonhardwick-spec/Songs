[Intro]
(
Stupid Dog, I ain't gon' lie, this bitch hard
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bitch, I'm working magic, pouring potion at The Hip Hop Lab
Turtle Pie hit for six hunnid for the Ziploc bag
7.62s make his ass hit a TikTok dance
Road running, only G station, ain't no pit stops, man
Shooter versus shooter? Bitch, I got a hunnid slips on stand
Them ain't Mike Amiris, bitch, you had to nerve to rip yo pants?
Talking foreign cars, you ain't never went to drift no land
Out here rapping knowing damn well you don't get no bands
A plus, bitch, I'm talking excellent
Back then for the giffies, would've walked to Lexington
B22s nowadays, I'm walking elegant
Brodie off some medicine and kill you off adrenaline
Pocket full of dead prezis, wrist got a skeleton
In Louisiana, team scoring like the Pelicans
Bitch asked do I win, shit, do the Devil sin?
10K or better if you ever catch me sell a BIN
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Huh, shit, we on one
Should we hop up in the booth or go and road run?
SBDSM, bitch, we got out own guns
Keep our name up out yo mouths, bitch, you don't know none
Always posting sticks on the 'Gram? Bitch, blow some
Always talking pape' in yo raps but never show none
You want a bad bitch but can't afford to get her toes done?
Shit, you on one
