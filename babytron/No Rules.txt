[Intro: TrDee]
Awstria
Fucking bitch-ass nigga
[Verse 1: TrDee]
I know you wanna fuck a rich-ass nigga
You know yo dad raised a bitch-ass nigga
Old bitch-ass nigga can't fuck with my team
You just mad that my money talk, huh, Charlie Sheen
I ain't gon' lie, if I was you, I would hate myself
I think yo bitch wanna fuck with me 'cause she see my belt
Caught the opps out in traffic, point it like I see the help
Let me dive head first in it, Michael Phelps
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
In the A, I just linked up with Dorien
Got that fire on my side, feel like Scorpion
Palm Angels t-shirt, feeling glorious
Feel like a star player, I been scoring shit
You save hoes? Okay, Captain Underpants
I don't got a lil' bitch, ask yo other man
At the self-scan, yes, that's another jam
Oh, the sauce? That's five hundred, brother man
[Verse 3: Samuel Shabazz]
I told that bitch to suck it well, I'm not yo other mans
She gon' suck dick and go home with her pussy untouched
[?] bitch to save her but there really ain't nothing
Smooth criminal, she gotta go home uncuffed
[?] young niggas make me really get the uncle in me
Everything free in the mall, go and fuck it, dummy
Bitch, you gotta see we gon' ball, feel like I'm Zion
Sorry for the wait that it take but I like the [?]
