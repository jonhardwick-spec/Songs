[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Slamming demons off my back, been through hell and back
Amiris with the snakes, in the coupe yelling slatt
Grab the bitch by her hair, who she yelling at?
Bitch wanna build a bridge with me, I ain't telegraph
[Verse 2: StanWill]
If I decline in store, God strike me down
If they ten deep, how I let the chop fight the crowd
Ghost status with the punchwork, feel like Tyson now
Funny how I used to run tracks but I ride write 'em now
[Verse 3: West Warren Cee]
Got the .30 on a Glocky like I'm Kenneth [?]
All this water on my neck like I'm Michael Phelps
Put a one on dawg and [?] kill [?]
Got so many bands on me like I'm in a jazz fest
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Slam dunking yo bitch like I play center
Me and Stan ran it up off the same vendor
Just fucked TCF up but Chase better
Bro'll shoot yo ass through the window like he FaZe Temperrr
