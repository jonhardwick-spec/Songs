[Chorus]
Bitch, I had a status before Tom added my MySpace
Condo out the way, when winter hit, I'm finna migrate (Brrrt)
My plays, my weight, my chains, my pape', my eights, my drank
You wish that you was me, don't you?
Fly way the highway, pint help me hydrate
Got the game on lock, a hundred M's, I got the key for you
[Verse 1]
You ain't a stacker, you got zero like Hector Zeroni (Shit)
Clip glued to my pelvis, I step into Coney (Brrt)
Lil' brodie Kenny Smith how he jet in the stoley (Skrrt)
Olympian, shit, how I'm feeling, my necklace a trophy
VVs got me chilly, shit, I caught the sniffles
J. Crawford, score a four off the dribble
In that Bat Mobile, we spinned the block, they tryna solve the riddle (What?)
Too official, all I'm missing is a ball and whistle
Shit, I'm speeding in the Demon, it's not a Camaro
Living like the mob, Goodfellas, I'm Robert Di Nero (The boss)
Rocking all this gold, I'm on top like a pharaoh
Pull up to the spot to get some gas, this is not the Valero
When I'm rocking apparelYohji Yamamoto, boy, I be dropping dineros
Robbing through the hood, you might get shot with an arrow
I was Prada'd up, double strapped, you was rocking some Aero (Yeah, yeah)
