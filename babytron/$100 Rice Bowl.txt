Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1]
Fuck around and throw a Hail Mary when I'm 4th & inches
Bitch like Dior bags and fur, can afford her kitten
'RT barking, nah, the neighbors can't ignore the drift
He ran up then he heard a "boom", what a poor decision
In the A with Dre, Trackhawk, yeah, we soaring in it
Sipping on the Wock' while I fuck until snoring in it
Looking Asian off the cookie but it ain't no fortune in it
I can't even cuff a lil' bitch 'cause y'all whores be finished
Twelve Pro Max, five twelve, thirteen in jacks
Throw a punch this way? I'm shooting, I ain't swinging back
Used to be nice, horns grew and my wings dethatched
You blow eighty-seven regular, this some diesel gas
Captain Obvious, shoelaces, they say "Shoelaces"
On telegraph, Captain Jay's or I can Nu Wave it
Sniper lock his target in his scope, we don't do chasing
We'll cut you off at the head, we don't do snaking
[Hook]
He be kissing on that runner, he a fool, ain't he?
Me and gang upping shit on live, we some fools, ain't we?
I been winning lately, I can give a fuck 'bout who hate me
Need a "yes" or "no" if it's money, I don't do "maybe"
Ain't nobody got you but you, that's how life go
Out of town hibachi, hundred dollars for a rice bowl
I'm her favorite rapper so I fucked her with my ice on
I might leave the mic for a month and get my swipe on
