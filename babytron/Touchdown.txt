[Intro: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
Yeah
Yeah
[Verse 1: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
So many real niggas done died just from fuckin' 'round with fake
So many rich niggas in jail just for tryna get some pape'
I'm in the 580 Benz, this ain't the kind of car that you race
I'm downtown runnin' through lights, gettin' head while I'm facin'
I'm feelin' like I won a ring, today, we poppin' bottles then
She let me fuck, but she ain't suck the dick, I told her, "Baby, not again"
I was really just doin' shit, I already fucked her friend
First time my mama seen me with that gun, she told me tuck it in
This that big body Benz, you see me swervin'
That ho bad, but I heard she ain't got no money, I'ma curve hеr, yeah
Ain't know the game whеn she met me, I made her learn it
My young nigga tryna catch his third body, he determined
House big, the bed came with some stairs, that bitch huge
I just got the carpet cleaned, when you come in, take off your shoes
I don't really play no games, you play with me, then you gon' lose
Like a lunch lady at your high school, I sell food, yeah
[Chorus: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
Touchdown, we just scored, call the plug for some more
I been runnin' up them bands, brodie just got off of tour
T-shirts, they off-white, you grab one, I need a quarter
And if I let you hold some money, I'm gon' need it in the morning
Touchdown, we just scored, call the plug for some more
I been runnin' up them bands, brodie just got off of tour
T-shirts, they off-white, you grab one, I need a quarter
And if I let you hold some money, I'm gon' need it in the morning
