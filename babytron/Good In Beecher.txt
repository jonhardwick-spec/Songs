[Intro: BabyTron &
RMC Mike
]
Huh, akhi play with TNT, hit yo block and fire, yeah
What up, Gramz? What up, Stupid Dog?
Bitch
Ayy, huh
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Akhi play with TNT, hit yo block and firebomb it
Call lil' brodie "Tony Stark", he keep that iron on him
Two charms bust straight from Hutch got me shining on 'em
Cuz got a pockets full of hitters, Mike Tysons on him
Treat freeways like landing strips, I be flying on 'em
Strikers ain't got no plates on 'em when we sliding on 'em
In the jungle with some killers, put some lions on 'em
Drew Brees thigh pads on me, put the .9 up on him
Good in Beecher, bitch, I'm tapped in with them sack runners
Unky, he don't drink no Wock', he used to be a Act' guzzler
Working like a team, I got the front, bro got the back covered
Smooth with the words but fuck around and let the MAG stutter
Cheese on an opp's head, he's an Aaron Rodgers fan
Embosser and a writer, never worked with pots and pans
Bullets hot as hell, I shot 'em at him, think he got a tan
Course there's 'bows around, dumbass, I'm in the spot with Gramz
[Verse 2: YSR Gramz]
I'll have BabyTron jugg you, yeah, we gotta ham
I been taxing niggas for a long time, Uncle Sam
Nigga, calm the fuck down, you is not the man
Pull a chop out on a nigga, make that nigga ran
"How this young nigga out the city?", I'm from Beecher, man
I can teach you how to get some money, I'm a teacher, man
Pull up to a opp nigga house like a pizza man
This nigga talk too much, he a preacher, man
I lost my nigga [?] got me going brazy
Yo baby daddy broke, y'all got a broke baby
I know some niggas throwing up them C's, they be going crazy
You don't get no motherfucking money 'cause you fucking lazy
I ain't talking 'bout no bitch, he come take yo soul, baby
Put a bitch on that nigga, take his pole, baby
I be fresh as hell, that Off-White, you rock Old Navy
I be walking with a stick, nigga, like a old lady
