[Chorus: ZayBang]
I just let these niggas watch from the nose bleeds
And I just gotta have a bitch who bring in proseeds
I don't think I'm ever kicking juice, I'm a dope feend
I like the Monclair collar with the show sleves
I be tucked behind 10, they don't know me
You probably catch me in New York in a long sleve
I can tell them fuck niggas hot, they in the nose bleeds
And if I lose somebody close, we gon fasho bleed
[Verse 1: ZayBang]
I just knocked a bitch, she for the [?] team
And I don't do no [?] I need the whole thing
Bad bitch still bussin checks out of dope feends
[?] his baby mama swallo nut, like it's protеin
[?] better tuck your nuts, you catch a headshot
Evеrytime I try to go to sleep, I'm seeing dead opps
Hella pose, they gon think we got these bitches dead stop
Way before I went to 7 grade [?] pop
Rob [?]
On my mama, niggas capped out
Everyday I'm tryna send a bitch, or send a pack out
G 23, I'm on tip when I back out
Make a opp bitch eat the dick with the strap out
[Chorus: ZayBang]
I just let these niggas watch from the nose bleeds
And I just gotta have a bitch who bring in proseeds
I don't think I'm ever kicking juice, I'm a dope feend
I like the Monclair collar with the show sleves
I be tucked behind 10, they don't know me
You probably catch me in New York in a long sleve
I can tell them fuck niggas hot, they in the nose bleeds
And if I lose somebody close, we gon fasho bleed
