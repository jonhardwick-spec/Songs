You was the best of me
Ayy
[Verse 1]
I loved you for you, it was me I hated (I hated)
Yeah I used to have trust, let my demons take it (Let 'em take it)
And I should've stayed bein' patient (I should've)
Went for it all, fourth down, and I ain't even make it (Make it)
I promise this is yo' spot (It is)
Know I'm skinny, but my heart weighs a whole lot (A whole lot)
How I feel in your arms, it ain't no comp' (Yeah)
Yeah, I did wrong, but how we turned out, I'm so shocked (Shocked)
Everything I ever said was truthfully (The truth)
I always seen the love and thought it was true to me (A hunnid)
I understand you needed room to breathe (I did)
Scared I'll be a Juice WRLD, havin' lucid dreams (Crazy)
It's fucked up, my lungs don't work (They don't)
How you think I feel hearin' that we won't work? (How you think?)
All the shit that we did, man, I'm so hurt
Finna numb the pain with this Perc', finna po' purp
[Chorus]
A cup of lean, maybe a pill or two
How I'm 'posed to live knowin' they ain't real as you? (How?)
If the tables turned, wonder would you feel it too? (Would you?)
Nah, for real, would you feel it, boo? (I wonder)
No cap, I've been missin' you (I have)
Yeah it's real in this world, bae, we livin' proof (We are)
The vibe that I get, hope you feel it to (I pray)
See our limits in the sky, fuck the ceilin', boo (The sky)
