[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse 1: $weet-T]
No more Oodles of Noodles, it's bovines and crustaceans
Crud so loud, it'll leave you in a state of sedation
Got a banger on my waist in case of altercations
I'll put some holes in your Goose, I'm good with alterations
You gotta redefine the nature of our association
'Cause I'm far above your station with little imitations
'Bout to have Tron call Kosher
, get me plugged with the Haitians
If you think I'm 'bout to flop, you got the wrong indications
They think I'm a easy lick, to me, they look like pawns
Big strap in the whip, I pick brain over brawns
I hit your girl on the hip, get some brain, then I'm gone
I'm in the upper echelon, you see me cookin' with Tron
I been showin' out, it ain't a mystery
The contacts in my phone look like your search history
Fuck around with $weet? You must be craving misery
All I know is victory, my chicken flippin' like rotisserie
I don't talk a lot, but all my thoughts would astound you
I called the chop mama bear, it'll clean your crib and ground you
All that fightin' shit is sus, I ain't finna ground and pound you
I roll dolo, but I pull up with the gang and surround you
But I wouldn't be caught dead with your poor ass
They know I'm quick to treat a rat like a doormat
Bars clean like Borax, I sorted out the format
Mag stuffed to the brim, I'll dump it in your thorax
Pass the stick to habibi, have him cook you up the ocky way
The kick'll make you lean back and do the Rockaway
How you talkin' crazy? Your people stay a block away
Might is right, that's just the way I operate
The 7.62s'll chop you up like the Yakuza
Drop the two in my kombucha and turn that bitch fuchsia
Bars I give out are gold, I'm the white Mansa Musa
The blick will make you freeze up, that's why I call it Medusa
In the suite with two hoes that look like Angie and Carmen
Women think I'm charmin', so coochie's what I'm harmin'
All my crud's super loud just like Harman Kardon
You be hidin' from your opps, when I see mine, I'm farmin'
