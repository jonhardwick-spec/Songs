Ahem
Pew
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Catch him fishbowlin', we'll reel his ass in
Get the lo' at nine, he ain't livin' past ten
You ain't DSM, better not think your ass kin
Only fuck Barbie hoes, boy, I think my ass Ken
Skrrt the AMG, I done fucked around and spilled my pop
Bro ain't got no screws left, he just wanna kill some opps
Got your bitch reachin' for my dick, but she feel the Glock
Throw your helmet on, boy, you really in the field or not?
This a contact sport
Keep a Glock on me, this ain't
Mortal Kombat
, dork
You don't want your bitch fucked, better hide that whore
Heard he gettin' off at three, we gon' slide at four
[Verse 2: Tae Retro]
Finna throw his ass a bullеt since he tryna intercеpt
And this bitch talkin' foul in this new season tech
Finna slide four deep like I'm finna run the rec
Finna leave an opp holy, got him thinkin' that he blessed
Huh, and I ain't talkin' biblical
Why your bitch tryna check on me like a physical?
Hit the stu', sacrificin' beats like a ritual
He ain't shootin', he only talk about it, it's mythical
Stan keep a nineteen tucked, not no Android
Tron 'Wood stuffed with moon rock, call it asteroid
She sendin' paragraphs, I can't read like I know Floyd
How the fuck I'm bringin' checks in when I ain't employed?
Let me hear that
