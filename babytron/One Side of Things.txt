[Intro]

[Chorus]
I’m on the one side of things, active
I’m on the one side of things, stacking
You on the one side of things, capping
You on the one side of things, lacking
Let me see a nail, I’m the Bounce Back Bandit
Shit, let me fall off, gon’ bounce back standing
SOD, six deep, where yo house at? Camping
Let a tape flop, I’ma bounce back scamming
[Verse 1]
Sipping plain promethazine, you got regular potion
Catch you in the jungle off an Addy, my predator focused
Doggy Presidential ticking, that’s a senator on him
Shit, I’m just heating up, bitch, the temperature rose
Cuddy broke a thirty into thirds, he took a crescent moon
Sliding in a Masi’,
this bitch topless like a legend too
Bent the corner crazy off the Quag’, I left the fender loose
Treat her like a Frappuccino, hit her with the blender move
[Chorus]
I’m on the one side of things, active (one side)
I’m on the one side of things, stacking (one side)
You on the one side of things, capping (one side)
You on the one side of things, lacking (one side)
Let me see a nail, I’m the Bounce Back Bandit
Shit, let me fall off, gon’ bounce back standing
SOD, six deep, where yo house at? Camping
Let a tape flop, I’ma bounce back scamming
