[Intro: StanWill]
Three-five of, yeah, bitch (
Ayo, Sebastian, run that shit the fuck back
)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Three-five of Pink Runtz got my bitch stuck like a stepsis
Every day, check another model off my checklist
Straight to it with yo bitch, chilling without Netflix
Closet looking like a porno, all these fucking X's
Bitches staring ’cause it's Benji's busting out my Ksubi denim
Bitch, it’s five percent's on every whip, they don't know who be in 'em
Triple S's fatter than a bitch, I'm looking goofy in 'em
Bought some toilet paper for my pockets 'cause it’s dookie in ’em
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
(Dog Shit Militia)
Riding 'round tinted AMG, feel like the U.S. Army
Wholе lotta red on my shoes, I’m finna do the Carti's
Finna hit thе lot, I told the dealer, "Come and supercharge me", huh
Riding 'round in fast tinted shit, the dash limitless
If the convo ain't about no pape’, I'm finna finish it
Why the biggest games, I be feeling like I'm scrimmaging?
White buffs vanilla, unky out here serving cinnamon
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Right pocket got the Glock, left pocket full of chicken
Popping out with thirty-rounders, catch him, we gon' fully switch him
I could let my dawgs up off that leash and have my bullies sick him
Lil' bro'll wreak some havoc but his tee say Good Intentions
Collins Ave' tripping, skrrting 'round in Scat Packs
Flash 'round them robbers? You'll get yo racks jacked
Yop got a skillet, beat and flipped his flapjack
All 2022, can catch me in my backpack, ayy
