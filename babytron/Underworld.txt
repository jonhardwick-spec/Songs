[Verse 1: StanWill]
Bitch got super head, she my Wonder Girl
Hit him up top, send him down to the underworld
I just pulled three phones off my uncle Earl
He ain't thinking with his brain, Glock make his onion twirl
Gunslinging on the West, I ain't Erron Black
Opps ain't expect us to hit 'em with a air attack
Pray to God that my niggas make it there and back
Feel like Mister Apple, I just turned in a pair of jacks
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Niggas only shoot paper balls in the trash
Only thing I got is SB, they ain't play clash
Real drip stepper, heard my first word was "splash"
You not getting a penny, a purse, or a lash
This a different ball game, stay in your lane, sport
Scams took my life, cameras snatched me off the court
I know we up, nigga, I don't gotta check the score
Hammer in the whip, yes, I pulled up with Thor
