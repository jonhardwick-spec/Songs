Enrgy made this one

[Verse]
Double cup, Chic-Fil-A ice, pourin' Polynesian
Masked up, skatin' 'round, you'd think it's hockey season
Said he did somethin' to me, dog was probably dreamin'
Would've thought my Iron low, the VVs got my body freezin'
CVVs do so much damage, probably think it's Rocky swingin'
Doggybone an undercover, caught him tryna tuck his badge
Played the cards that they dealt, and ended with the upper hand
Bail out don't count, you ain't never touched no sand
Pandemic don't count, you ain't never touched no bands
You a snake and then be shakin', I can't even touch your hands
Gotta get up and get to it, might not get that one more chance
Hypnotised by them hundreds, blues got me stuck on trance
Ain't a thing in your stash, please tell me what's your plan?
One head 50K, call that shit a jumbo scam
Unky wearin' steel toes, must be 'bout to stomp on tan
This a fuckin' TRX, you'll pullup truck on Ram
Fit cost an arm, leg, and the head with the neck
Finna foul out, two TECs, stuffed 'em in my Tech
This just everyday shit, ain't dressin' to impress
Heard it's backdoor season, met him on the deck
Got a book of dead presis, call it social studies
Recordin' off the Quagy-agy, got my vocals muddy
You ain't got a dollar in that suit, how you a mogul, buddy?
Cuddy got some 'cross-the-border work, servin' local junkies
Banana clip in my Bape denim
Loose leaf full of poison like I rolled up snake venom
For that queso, we'll wrap him up just like Qdoba
How you blow exotic? That don't even got a light aroma
Me and Fordi split a pint, I'm tryna fight a coma
Experimentin' with my soda, turn the Sprite to cola
Overdid the shrooms, right now, I'm tryna find a sofa
Sent a buck shot, watch the bullets spread just like Corona
Boy, your Sprite potionless, and your life motionless
Album droppin' Halloween, I'm finna ghost the whip
I don't do the three-five, smoke a 'bow by zips
You ain't gotta turn the lights off to know I'm lit
