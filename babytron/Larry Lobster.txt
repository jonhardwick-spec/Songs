[Verse]
I could lose both hands, wouldn’t drop the bag
Slam dunked in yo bitch, I’m Juwanna Mann
Fire stick, heat ‘em up like a lava lamp
I just turned my cream soda to a Baja Blast
And what you gotta know, I am not a ham
Don’t let this haircut fool you, I’ll pop his ass
Call me "Jimmy Neutron", let the rocket blast
I think 2021 I'ma drop a Lamb'
Bro cut as hell, throw some scissors at him
Bro came through shooting like Swizzomatic
I’m the Scam Prince, bitch, I’m living lavish
Got his bank login and made digits vanish
And I’m feeling like Zeus, I’m with the static
Good Saks Fifth, it used to be Mr. Alan's
You are not a all-star, need a little practice
Ham-ass lil' girl, boy, that bitch a sandwich
And if it’s beef? Of course we on that
All these punches, all these slides, Mortal Kombat
Talking 'bout that one time? I’m beyond that
So deep in that bag, that’s where Tron at
And what you gotta know is I ain’t leaving ever
Playing with the fraud, I ain’t ever seen a tester
That lil' bitch baldheaded, she need a vender
And if it’s up then it’s stuck, we can meet wherever
But if we meet wherever, you gon' meet Jesus
I don’t play with the Masters, I keep Visas
I want a lamb chop, I don’t eat pizza
I think I’m finna come Wraith, boy, this Jeep tweaking
Feeling blessed on the site, I’m a peace deacon
Should've known you was soft, writing peace treaties
If she see me in this fit, she gon' eat semen
Bro riding round with that, he keep tweaking
Lying to these hoes, Hakuna Matata
Seen two opps, wrapped them up, that’s two enchiladas
Shirt got a bulldog, I should hoop for Gonzaga
Don’t even slide down, I'ma shoot yo Impala
Human Torch with the cards, I’m using lava
Whole gang turnt up, who the fuck gon' stop us?
And we can be Faygo, who the fuck gon' pop us?
We can hit rock bottom, who the fuck gon' top us?
Dwayne Johnson with the scams, I’m The People's Champ
Two sticks causing fires, I don’t need to camp
Capping-ass boy, where the fuck yo beanie at?
Having withdrawals from the bank, boy, I need to scam
Breastfeeding with the chop, throw some titties on it
Had yo bitch rub my back 'cause the city on it
Bro threw me a beat, I jumped shitty on it
And I'ma win, I could put all my giffies on it (Winner)
Like, come on, I’m Giffy
Rubio
Tryna play with me? Boy, stick to Yu-Gi-Oh
I’m a fire bender when I hit the studio
Bend her over and you know I did the fooley, bro
And I can’t lose power, I got jumper cables
Seen an opp at Ruth Chris, almost jumped the tables
Wish I can time travel, that slut ungrateful
Shout-out to Comcast, I punched the cable
Only punch online, I don’t throw fists
Only choke on mines, she don’t blow dickMan, you know that I'm lying, she on ho shit
Something like a bitch with no ass, I won’t switch
And I’m like 6'1" in the Timberlands
6'8" on the paint, bitch, I been the shit
And I'ma leave the ho dizzy when I spin the bitch
Turned nothing into something, on some wizard shit
I’m a wizard with the fraud, feel like Harry Potter
Knocked the bitch out the park, I'ma Barry Bonds her
Smoking strong-ass cook, this some Larry Lobster
And my bitch work magic, she Mary Poppins
