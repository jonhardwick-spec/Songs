[Intro]
(
Fuck the fire, we got grease
)
Phew, huh
Heroes gon' prevail (
Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby
)
Villains might win the battle, they ain't gon' win the war, though, you know?
Jugg in piece, $cams
Long live the PA prince
You know?
[Verse]
Granny said I need to slow down, but I can't take a break
Even being off a lil' bit can be a great mistake (Phew)
Back of my mind talking to me like, "Get up and make a play"
On the breakaway, no, I ain't layin' up, gon' take the tray
You ain't make the plates, nor you ain't say the grace
You can't eat with us, they ain't believe in us
Now they locked out the door and see we got the keys with us
You ain't bleed with us, you ain't dream with us
Hundred .308s same night, you try and beef with us
Mixin' 'shrooms with the juice, finna time travel
I'm on TV now, I came from five channels
Might got some scars, never back down from life's battles
201s fire than a bitch, could probably light candles
Fuck school, you a prime example
Went to college, still broke, I guess life's a gamble
Shit, it couldn't be me
Dog lame as hell, I heard his jeweler cookin' CZs
Shit, that couldn't be me, naw
The shit that knock you down probably tickle to me
Lieutenant, if I make the call, I bet they get it to me
If I place him in a grave, bro gon' dig 'em for me
When you up, they call, I was down and they ain't pick up for me
Shit, all I heard was cricket
Yeah, I know how nothin' feel, but I was still workin' with it
Unky overdid the recipe and almost burned the kitchen
No face, no case, but we had to murk the witness
It ain't no point in slowin' down now
Heard we down six points, time to throw it down now
Blowin' loud, thank God that the booth soundproof
Shit, I had squat-diddly, now I'm whippin' out blues
If your name ain't pape', bitch, I won't trip about you
Full-court press season, we ain't givin' out room
Man, I hear his time tickin', doggy finished, shit, boom
Set the play up at eleven, tryna get it by noon (Phew)
He gon' always run his mouth, never up a check
What brodie got up in the trunk cost a bust Patek
Diamonds dancin' hard as fuck, I think I seen him bust a sweat
If you seein' young Tron, you know he thugged in MEKs
I'm talkin' 'bout way before I ever touched a TEC
Have you seen what I did? Don't get enough respect
But it's good, on God, I ain't done just yet
