[Chorus: BLP KOSHER]
Tron could've went to the leagueI could've been in the Pro Open
She said she wanted a weaveI bought a Bottega bag and that shit woven
I fucked up some commas, now they on their periodI leave the opps with a semicolon
And the opps broke, they got no motion
They only want beef like Joe Rogan
[Verse 1: BLP KOSHER]
Me and Tron on a yacht, brought the Wock' and the pole in
We in Flint tryna rock, we eroding
Horseback, she gon' ride me, no Trojan
The chopper go waterrr, pool coping
The bread make him wonder round never been loafin'
I'm steppin' on toes 'til my shit swollen
And I'm a rapper, man, I could've been a postman
Hope my son shred like I'm Steve Olson
I'm a top Jew, now they sayin' token
My brothers died and I ain't even mourn yetMy brothers died and I'm still broken
They had to try my heart, came out the crib
I'll never go back to window pokin'
It's James and Benyamin, you heard what Iâ€”It's James and Benyamin, you heard what I said
I'll cop a Cyber Truck 'fore I go bullyin' jits on the web
Pick your poison, is it them or the lead?
Pass it to Tron and he leaving it dead
Real dolphin like Dan Marino
Big dreidel, not a man of ego
Glock on my pant leg, hit a coffee stainNo cap in chino, ayy
