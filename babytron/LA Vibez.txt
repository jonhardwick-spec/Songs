[Intro: BabyTron]
Woo, ha, ayyy
Hokatiwi
You did your thing on this bitch
Woo, ayyy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Don't play, I'll send a bullet through your chest
She seen Amiris on my jeans, course she threw back
Used to be down bad, now I superflex
In Downtown L.A., like "Should I do the 'Vette?" (Skrrrrt)
Just tore Saks down, need a sponsorship (Tore it down)
Lil bitch used to spin, now she on my dick (Lil slut)
Hit the Runtz and flew up like a rocket ship
AirPods in, feet up while I politic
In L.A. makin plays like I'm Kawhi Leonard (Makin plays)
F-R-A-U-D, love them five letters (Fraud, fraud)
Her credit great, but she trippin shit, I might let her (Shit)
I can't see you winning dude, like ever (Huh, like ever)
Foreign bitch feed me pita bread and hummus (Woooo)
At the self scan, if the VISA bad, I'm runnin' (Ayy, ayy)
If I ain't at the mall, then I'm scammin something
Bro Handy Manny, yeah he got a hammer on him
Bitch fuckin on a scammer, think she JT
Barack, Iâ€™m tryna fuck around and drop a AP
The Glock like a punt return, ain't got no safety
RIP Kobe, see an opp, I'm droppin 80
Sick she came cowabunga when she see the wave (Surf)
I'll blow this bitch mind, she seen what I make
Mean mugging in the function, brodie bring the K
Yeah this new bass fire, it's a VISA day
Told the opps when I see you, I'ma bust y'all
Told the bitch I won't catch you if we trust fall
Real fetish over money, man I love fraud
I just fucked up the gram when I upped dog
Woke up to this bitch, like, "Damn, what happened?"
I'ma probably burn in hell, I done scammed her grandma
If I get her login, then her bands gon' vanish
Why you trippin over hoes? Need to practice balance
