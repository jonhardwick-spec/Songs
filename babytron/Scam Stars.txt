[Chorus: AllStar JR]
Real ratchet, twelve hundred on some jeans (This shit crazy)
Bad habits, 'nother band on my feet (Thou'-wow)
Get my dick sucked, pulling up on fiends (Phew)
Fuck the trap, nigga, Tron got me scamming all week, ayy (Showed me something)
Real ratchet, twelve hundred on some jeans (On some pants, nigga)
Bad habits, 'nother band on my feet (One thousand)
Get my dick sucked, pulling up on fiends (I love to get your head)
Fuck the trap, nigga, Tron got me scamming all week, nigga
[Verse 1: BabyTron &
AllStar JR
]
Off-Whitе tee from Loose Cannon with the polka dots
Me and JR, wе all-stars, catch us throwing lobs
Bitch said I ain't the punch god, think she smoking rocks
Scam vet, but still can make the yola and the soda lock (
Skrrt, skrrt
)
[Verse 2: AllStar JR]
I don't need seasoning, but niggas throwing salt
Throw a fin bullet at his head, that's gon' throw him off (Baow)
I got a bitch who got a nigga that just blow her off (Damn)
I sell blow and soft, Dior hoodie really soft
