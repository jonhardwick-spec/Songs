[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
Phew
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, look
[Chorus]
Motion picture, shit, my life is cinematic
Long as it got codeine, I'ma grab it, got a sippin' habit
Spendin' every day up in the jungle, had to get adapted, huh
Glocky with a switch, this bitch kick like Trish Stratus
Ain't no hash browns in the kitchen, only grits action
Cuddy never showed his face, he do the wig splattin'
Overdid the 'shrooms, I'm readin' English like it's pig Latin
If the bag in the water, who gon' swim fastest?
If the bag underground, who gon' dig fastest?
Merry Christmas, unky took a brick and gift-wrapped it
Talkin' 'bout we broke, you must've smoked crack and mixed acid
[Verse]
Thеy call lil' brodie Bean 'cause hе stalk shit
Fell asleep in my kit, now I'm frostbit
Jefe jeans Off-White, but he off Tris
Broke hoes, get away, I'm exhausted
Beware of my surroundings, movin' with some caution
Feel like Jayson Tatum, groovin' all through Boston
After we kill him, we gon' shoot him through the coffin
All the zombies on the block, unky movin' like Richtofen
One row out the polka dot, that's therapeutic
He had the wide-open bucket, was so scared, he blew it
Had the field to hisself, got tackled just a yard short
Flexin' like he rich on the 'Gram, but livin' cardboard (That's a damn shame)
