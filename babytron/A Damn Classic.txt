[Intro: StanWill]
(
Shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
Huh, ayy, damn
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Huh, bitch, I'm energized
Tippy-toes say "43", this a different size
I can thrust up, you fucked up, we live different lives
I'll blow the cape off him, Glock got some Kryptonite
Text her at 10:17 like, "Put the WAP on me"
Turned the trap to Benihana's, I got the chop on me
Unc' running 'round like Dwayne, he got the rock on him
Funny how the green light stopped him, that's the Glock on me
I just hit Walmart and caused a fire drill
Tron in the Challey, he just love how the tires squeal
Bitch want a scammer, she wanna know what it's like, for real
That damn Hutch, he hit my neck with some ice, for real
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Yo damn bitch, she done hit me with some crazy head
They can start the beef but we ain't stopping till the niggas dead
Knew this shit was real when I was making money in a bed
Knew I really had a roll when it was falling when I spread
Knew she really had me bent 'cause she want me to punch her rent
They get caught, you keep it pushing, boy, you better hop the fence
I can really get you money, all you need is common sense
I can hit them niggas coming, ain't no need to call a hit
She telling me that pussy mine, you really think it's only yours?
Told that boy to use his mind before we mop it with the floor
Tell that nigga check the camera before he answer any door
Used to fuck up all the Wally's, now we hitting every store
