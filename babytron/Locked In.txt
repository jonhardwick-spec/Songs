[Intro]
Ayy, J.K
Bitch, it's BabyTron
I stay locked in, I stay locked in
Ha-ha, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1]
Backdoored yo bitch like she was pressing at the three
Swiping shit for fun, I get the blessins for the free
BabyTron, I'm the GOAT, you cannot mess with me
I got the sauce and the, you need the recipe
Flash a hundred, I'ma take a hundred like a damage trap
Sitting on the porch, I wonder where the package at
You broke as hell with no grind, how you manage that?
Don't jump stupid on bro 'cause I'ma have his back
Elgin Baylor put this twenty-two to yo back
Down in Taylor turn around and then I brought it back
I'll do you a favor, I'ma teach you how to stack
Real gon feel real and everything I said is facts
Lou Will 'cause when I come in, I'ma change the game
I was made solid, you gon' fall, we ain't made the same
ShittyBoyz lieutenant, man, I wake up and I make a play
If I want you gone, it's gon' happen, it won't take a day
[Chorus]
If I fuck with dawg, he got hustle and he locked in
I'm on the road OT, I stay locked in
I'm locked in, ain't talking cash? You need to stop then
BabyTron, I'm the Punch God, I stay locked in
I'm locked in, yeah, I'm locked in
If I fuck with dawg, he got hustle and he locked in
I'm locked in, ain't talking cash? You need to stop then
BabyTron, I'm the Punch God, I stay locked in
