[Intro]
Ayy, J.K
Mind on the money, got my mind on the bands
Mind on the Union, I'm in love with busting scams
Bring the kin to the top, I can't leave my mans
Fuck with me 'cause I'm balling now, stay up in them stands
Mind on the money, got my mind on the bands
Mind on the Union, I'm in love with busting scams
Bring the kin to the top, I can't leave my mans
Fuck with me 'cause I'm balling now, stay up in them stands
[Verse 1]
Sitting down chilling, praying that his play pop
Ju will blow yo ass like a whistle when the play stops
Wet as hell, fit dripping, I'm a walking rain drop
Two sleeves on me, you got none like a tank top (Bust it up)
What I'm saying is you're broke and I'm thrusted up
Would put you on but you someone I can't trust enough
On yo ass with no cash? Dawg, you really fucking up
Always been the flossing type, just know I ain't tuckin' none (Hell nah)
Tenth grade, had hoop dreams, I gave it up (I did)
ShittyBoyz, yeah, I'm the one who made it up
If you get some strips, I advise that you save it up
'Cause when you down with nothing, you can't make it up (Real shit)
I don't take L's, this piece undefeated
If it wasn't cooling on the strap, he'd get overheated
Game sliders ain't on, nah, baby, I ain't cheating
I just stack off the juggs, I know you heard "Scam Season" (I'm the code)
On the road bright and early, at the crack of dawn
You the type to hide, I'm the type to pull up at yo lawn
Bro got a strap, ready to blow like he just spawned
Time to get them phones so we hit the road and get 'em gone
[?] and
[?]
that's my kin from the cold
Can't forget about Jeff, he know about that roll (Huh)
Marshawn locking OT, he in punch mode
Red bottoms on my feet, they ask how I punch those (Fourteen-hundred)
