[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Paint a picture like I made the stencil
Fuck your whole image, I'm with Cole Bennett
I don't know what the fuck they done told niggas
I put all of my heart and my soul in it
Met you in person, you so different
I can't listen to you for a whole minute
Took a blood test, ain't no ho in it
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth 'fore I go in it
[Bridge: BabyTron]
Think I am below sea level
Cut your own wrist off with that weak bezel
Ride around with the Iron Giant, make 'em eat metal
Watch unc' break a rock down to three pebbles
Bam-bam, down three, hit the grand slam
Four pockets full, fully switchеd, go wham-wham
Pants cramp, pull it out, I'm countin' 'til my hands cramp
Wrote "DSM" on the beach, now thе sand stamped
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope
