[Verse 1: BandGang Javar]
This cold bitch just slid in my DMs, like what you doing, boo?
High school, she hoed me all the time, yeah, I remember you
She doubled back because I got more chicken than the petting zoo
I ain't gon' be petty, I'ma treat you like my other two
I fucked and hit her with that what you 'bout to get into?
I ain't heartless, when them scams dropped, she got a few
And I ain't stupid, when them phones dropped, she got approved
And I ain't greedy, off that 5K, I gave her 2
Bitch, put your facе on this ID, I don't want nude pics
Twenty pros, forty common names, you gon' makе ten quick
I can make a bitch, or I can break a bitch
Long as I get paid, I don't care who she fuck with
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Said that you know how to break a brick, should save it for the birds
Place a bounty by the second, bro gon' take it by the third
(Fuck around and die the next day, no hat)
(No fakin', ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia)
Told Javar to just deluxe the song, I had to hit the road
Sixty days, fifty shows, somewhere in your city blowed
Fuck around and stack six hundred jacks up off of fifty pros
Cuddy in the kitchen dog fetching, but ain't frizby throw
BandGang, ShittyBoyz, that's always a classic
Yeah. I grew up in the jungle, but, man, I always adapted
Bad as hell in school, but I always was absent
Turnt out for the pape, the blue strips, they always attractive
Shut the fuck up, you ain't been on shit since you was born
I wear Palm Trees ass, so you know me, I'ma do the foreign
Syracuse vibes, in New York, we got the blues and oranges
Balenciaga, paid a fucking rack, that's why the shoes enormous
Every L I seen, it was a lesson, all I know is triumph
All I know is victory, all I know is trophies
All I eat is hundred-dollar meals, like all you know is Coney
Must be fucked up in the city, must be fucked up rubbing pennies
If it ain't a supercharge in front of it, won't touch the hemi
If it ain't a fully switch up on it, I won't touch the semi
I be sipping Quagen in the Wocky, I won't touch the Remy
