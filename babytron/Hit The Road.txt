[Verse]
Yes, bitch, these red bottoms so don't break yo neck
But when I hit the road, I drive off in the Nike tech
Channing Frye to the scamming, I'm a fucking vet
Dawg, stop hating on me and go and get a check
Had to turn around, my backseat a fucking mess
Double G's on me, you will never catch me wearing Guess
Louis checkers on me, come and play a game of chess
Ten bands is my goal, I ain't coming back for less
You stressed, tripping on that ho, boy, you pressed
I'm blessed, can't you tell by the way I dress?
It's a mess, good hollows tearing up his flesh
ShittyBoyz thrusted up, all we know is flex
Yes, got more pieces on me than a damn puzzle
Suede Balenciagas on so I'm watching out for puddles
All the highlights that I made, I deserve a huddle
Two pieces hit for ten, that's a double-double
Mari owe me seventeen and he in the Beamer
White Balencis on, looking like some fucking coffee creamer
Hit the set with the giffies, fucking up Big Beaver
James in that black Jeep looking like the Grim Reamer
I got love for my [?] and that's to the grave
Nigga run up on me? I'ma send his ass to the grave
Run up on crazy on us? Yeah, bro, you mighty brave
Hold on, bro, I'll call you back, I got another play
Yes, that was us horsing niggas at the festival
Jeans cost six hundred, bitch, get off my testicles
You ain't street, stay in the crib and eat yo vegetables
You got a play? Of course my schedule flexible
My shooter pull up in that hoodie, call that nigga "Melo"
Take off them Space Jams, them bitches getting yellow
Stop smoking on them squares and them petty rellos
Red bottoms on my feet looking like I stepped in Jell-O
Asked what's on my feet? Just know these bitches foreign
Deep from the redzone, I'm talking [?]
I'm scoring, balling on these niggas like I'm Horace
You snoring, the whip woke you up, this bitch roaring
You boring, yo bitch said, "BabyTron do it better"
Giffies hitting hard as fuck, I punched a BAPE sweater
Broke niggas look up to me, I'm a trendsetter
Yeah, that's yo bitch but I promise you I make her wetter
I'm in here horsing niggas like equestrian
Hit the road off the juice, I might kill a pedestrian
And if I'm a bitch, come over here and test me then
Bro said he got a play, I just told him text me when
Got white boy shooting on my team like Pistol Pete
They'll take you out the game like when the whistle beep
Green and red Gucci looking like a fucking Christmas tree
Play with my cash and my dawg getting to gripping heat
