[Verse 1: StanWill]
Turn a opp to a poltergeist
BIN slamming, every clerk getting posterized
Comme des heart on, mine broke inside
If he slide, leave his whip holey like the pope inside
[Verse 2: TrDee]
I don't trust hoes, I don't know why you do
For me to love a bitch, they gon' have to do some voodoo
Sit and watch the mail, bitch, don't turn on no Hulu
Had to scream at his ass, boy, I know that ain't FUBU
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Man, this lil' freak a soul toucher
Got that blower in my bag like a ghostbuster
First draft pick, I'm damn near a pro puncher
Running from the coyotes, bitch, I'm a roadrunner
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Translate that bullshit you talking to Guapanese
Really shitting, Charmin Ultra ain't stopping me
Damn, show them bitches at Neiman's, I am copping please
Long range on the chopstick, bro dropping threes
