[Intro: BabyTron]
Huh, Air Forces 1s (
Ayo, Mark A
)
Huh, Air Forces 1s
Yeah, okay (Yeah)
Bitch, huh (ShittyBoyz)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Air Force 1s, I done ran through a hunnid pair
Bottom of my gun got a drum, it's a hunnid there
Hoes in the function, chain on, I bet a couple stare
Wintertime, a thousand dollar Moncler bubblewear
If it's up, might catch a body like I'm Miles Bridges
140 on the A, I'm flying down the mile tripping
I be the clerk believe the perp if I smile with it
Reach for this piece? I might end up on trial with it
[Verse 2: TrDee]
If you scuff 'em, you supposed to go and get another pair
They usеd to say I was the weakest, I ain't nеver care
Life just like a game but I was told that it ain't never fair
I'm so sick, I see her ass but she lacking hair
Off-White 1s, I'm the 2021 Nelly
Kinda mad my white bitch ain't never seen Belly
"
Stupid bitch
"
"
Bitch? Who the fuck you calling a bitch?
"
Ain't shit light ever with me, everything heavy
I'll put you on the route if you seem ready
