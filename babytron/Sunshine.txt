[Verse 1: J1Hunnit]
Can you feel the vibrations?
We a long way from home, this shit cause for celebration
I'm soaking this shit in, smokin' 'za and stargazing
A million dollars close, I feel a tingling sensation
Now I'm rubbing shoulders with the made man, ain't that crazy?
They introduced me as the sexiest man alive, a young Swayze
Or tell 'em call me Vince Carter, I'm half man, half amazing
The loud roaring like a raptor, them country boys are tailgating
In the Golden State, they clip it and ship it out with no fragrance
Then my clients take it to the headband, Baron Davis
Wе them ones, nigga, Tracy McGrady
The hoеs see me out and say hey, Lil Baby
(
Hey, this her first time coming to my house
)
The P's building blocks, I made a solid foundation
Forgis sitting offset, I'm taking off, burning pavement
What the Memphis nigga say? The bitch gave it
When the last time you seen the sunshine? Let's vacation
I know you wanna leave, I can change your location
We can see the Seven Wonders or some of Earth's great creations
Maybe make reservations, after that, some penetration
Is he getting on your nerves? Is it peace that you're craving?
She be texting me in caps, I can feel the frustration
She said, "Baby, I just wanna make love" in quotations
She come from a good home, I think her dad a Freemason
Unc' came lips chapped, I can tell he freebasing
