(
I got exotic pack

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Catch me pullin' pints up out the pantry
Catch me pull a trick and disappear just like I'm Gatsby
Lil' bro a savage, he gon' play it like he Randy
Two racks to Action Impact to buy a banshee
I ain't even test it at the range
Bring that black light and diamond tester for his chains (Ooh)
Applyin' pressure for the day
We applyin', applyin', 'plyin' pressure for the day
Mossberg, behind the stove, behind the dresser, it's the
Drac'
50 in the middle console, got a tester over pape'
Birdies migratin' South, we trimmin' feathers in the A
Never know when it's your last, so I'ma treasure every game
I'ma give it all I got, I just sipped up all the Wock'
Spin around and hit they block, spinned around until they dropped
Why you playin' with that chop? Why you playin' with that mop?
Why you playin' with that Glock? Why you playin' with that— eh
Why you playin' on that block? Why you playin'? You a bot
Why she playin' with that top? Why she playin'? She a bop
I just got some new— uh, finna play it with the— uh
If I see them blue troops, then I'm takin' off like— uh
[Verse 2: MJPAID]
Pop cost a dollar, it's a band in my pop
Fuck you actin' like you man and you not?
Band down the [?] on my jeans like I'm Pac
Irritatin' bitch, once I fuck, you blocked
How the fuck I'm not locked? I'm a con
I done made a ten off a dot-com
Q's on the A with Glock 9
Bands on me knot, hell no, I'm not signed
I ain't never trippin' on a bitch that's not mine
Bro, them lightskins fuckin' with the top side
Tron got chop, make a nigga cha-cha
All these niggas cap, niggas gettin' side-eyed
Nigga, stop lyin'
Chicken on me now, this shit Popeyes
That's at least a hundred racks when we pop out
Why you talkin' all that shit that you not 'bout?
Fuck it, I get locked in your city, I'ma bond out
