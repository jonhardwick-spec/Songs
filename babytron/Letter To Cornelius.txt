[Intro]
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?

[Verse]
I-75 the only time I work a night shiftPack of jammers on the freeway, I'm finna swipe shit
Real source, catch me plugged in by your light switch
Rollie on my left, bust Patek on my right wrist
I'm the type to go and get it, you will watch the time tick
Told my players in the field, "When they yell that hike, blitz"
Signed a record deal, shit, you should've read the fine printNow you on the shelf, finna spend your whole life pissed
Shit, the game is thе game, yeah, it's pros and cons
A band on your head'll gеt you banged on like old LeBron
A hundred dollar appetizer, we at Ocean Prime
Everybody sick the time came, but they know it's mines
Hope you got your blickiana 'cause I'm toting mines
Double cup, drop a V-cut, I'm too blowed to drive
Ocean drive flying, drop the top, finna float the ride
Take my pop and do some voodoo, pour a four inside
I was on the road, you was busy doing work in school
Shit, yeah, you heard of me, but I ain't heard of you
Life in this fucker, I cannot let 'em search the coupe
Had a pocket full of green dubs, then I turnt it blue
Cuz said the tans don't work, he done turnt to blues
I'm a vet, striped up, but lil' bro earned 'em too
Designer oversized, pissed that the shirt too loose
Feeling like a Raptor from Toronto in these purple Loubs
Gettin' up, I might honey dip, feel like Vince Carter
In the middle of the intersection, finna spin Chargers
To even keep the game fair, y'all gon' need six starters
Hitman one-shottin' shit, he don't get hit markers
You know why? 'Cause this life shit is not a game
We are not the same, hundred on me, we don't shop the same
You probably hoppin' off the bus, I'm hoppin' on a plane
Bro feeling grown, got that big face and copped it plain
Need the date included, I can't do just that Datejust
Caught him up close, small map, but it ain't Rust
Yesterday was Turtle Pie, today, I had to face Runtz
Two grams where? Boy, I only face eighth blunts
Brodie like the bottom of the 'bow, tryna shake somethin'
Preaching 'bout some bands, but did you wake up and make some?
Told my young bull keep going, yeah, the hate comes
Fly as hell in my Stone Island, I could BASE jump
Learned how to lose less, now I'm a gain-iac
Want a three five? Shit, it's eighty for the eighthy, jack
Brodie threw a bullet accurate like a Brady pass
Me being broke? You cornballs almost made me laugh
