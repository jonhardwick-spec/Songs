[Verse 1: Brooks]
Only thing G.O.A.T. is her throat, bitch love to blow
Lil' cuz love takin' shit, robbin' all he know
Your whole life a damn lie, I see your nose, Pinocchio (Lyin'-ass nigga)
You wanna have your way, bitch, stroke my ego
Told my nigga to go long, see how fast the bag can go
Told the bitch she ain't my main one, but she my favorite, though (You feel me, though?)
I ain't from the [?][0:19], but I love to showboat
Stick tucked, if it's gettin' up, just know it's time to go
Who the keys to the TRX?
Need the money right now 'fore this shit go left (Yeah)
See what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
[Chorus: Brooks]
Got this bitch callin' back, sayin' she want my dick (Yeah, you know what the fuck goin' on, yeah)
I'm geekin' off this pint, give them hoes that fifth
Got this bitch callin' back, sayin' she want my dick
I'm geekin' off this pint, give thеm hoes that fifth
[Verse 2: Brooks]
We some chain-swingin', ho slayеr, lean-drinkin' heathens
If she get caught in the wave, it's like you seen Houdini (Magic)
These niggas washed up, y'all see it
She an angel in the face, but suck dick like a demon
The youngin hid his face, that leg shot gon' leave him breathin' (Yeah)
I'll go geek boy for no reason (Bitch)
I'll go geek boy for no reason
