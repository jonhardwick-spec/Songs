[Verse: StanWill &
BabyTron
]
Sent the opp straight up, rocket style
On fire with this 201, it's volatile
Take that weak shit off, boy, you out of style
Trying new things, OT eating crocodile
Big chop gave dawg a tremendous death
Since I left my heart in the past, I ain't been depressed
In these big-ass Triple S's, I can't miss a step
Bitch, why the fuck you got a head if you ain't giving neck?
Up chop and do a opp karate style
I'm a well known granny scammer, it's a hobby now
Talking loose on the net will get your body found
Used to talk shit back then, it's wasabi now
That mean I talk very spicy
On my way to Golden Sun, finna have Gary ice me
Niggas in that room singing, tryna Barry White me
I don't scrap, I'ma up chop if he very feisty
Super deep in my bag, couldn't be complacent
Bitch snatched the soul out me, Aretha Franklin
All these sticks over over here, we could be the Yankees
Damn, Stan, we could be the Yankees
At the set skywalking, Stanakin
Took a dark path, seen light and abandoned it
Bitch talking 'bout love? She on shenanigans
Ape 'cause the chopstick strapped with banana clips
Up that bitch and pop dawg in his McNugget
Said I couldn't bring the Glock out but I'ma Chris Tuck it
She a ShittyGirl now, boy, yo bitch fucking
Shooter never seen a bench press but he'll lift something
My bitch got two friends, Dolce & Gabbana
All black 'Cat bending corners like I'm from Wakanda
That bitch kick like Neymar when I shoot the choppa
Crab legs in the fettuccine when I do the pasta
No cap, got a taste for exquisite shit
Way back before ShittyBoyz, I been the shit
Feel like Jax with that metal, I'll
finish him
I bet he ran straight out his Timberlands
Katana work, have Maurion slice you up
Talk a little slow, fuck with me and I'll spice you up
How you bougie? It took one night to fuck
Hop on the beat and it's gold, Midas touch
Yeah, I make more hits than Polamalu
Left my old slut in the dirt, now I'm popping models
I don't drink but we in Cali popping bottles
Bro got hella range on the stick, he'll Rocket Watt you
But if you got that sack on you, he'll J. J. Watt you
Let him think he on go, had the AK stop you
Pretty bitch on balls, I can't wait to pop you
Used to starve back then but now the steak colossal
BNB with a view in San Diego
Hoes ain't shit, I bet Dora ham Diego
Spice talk, huh, Stan fuego
I don't care if that bitch cute, I'll scam Zendaya[Outro: StanWill]I would scam the fuck out Zendaya lil' cute-ass
