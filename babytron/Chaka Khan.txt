[Verse 1: TrDee]
Touchdown, Tyreek Hill, you can catch me in yo city (Touchdown)
Niggas tryna copy me, I kinda feel like Diggy (No cap)
Touched ten a couple times, I'm tryna make my way to fifty (Double up)
I feel like a ugly bitch 'cause ain't nobody fucking with me (They can't)
I don't care about who hating, they gon' hate me anyway (Fuck them)
Bad bitch get what she want, her birthday just like any day (Bad bitch)
And she balling on these hoes like she looked up to Chelsea Gray
Finna bless her with this dick, shе on her knees just like she pray (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'ma sеnd him to his maker if he make me up the blick (Frrt)
I can't bring bro around 'cause he in all kind of shit (God damn)
I can't go nowhere without it, I live in the Murder Mitten (You hear?)
I don't really fuck with niggas 'cause these niggas counterfeit (They fake)
Baby, I'm in love with money, you can't have my heart (Uh-uh)
Nigga talking 'bout he balling, he don't even start (Fuck 'em)
Boy, yo diamonds fake 'cause I don't see 'em in the dark (Where they at?)
She like, "I heard 'Waffle House,' yo verse my favorite part" (For real?)
Oh, you think you Macho Man? Got Glocky just for that (Frrt)
Statie get in front and, boy, stop talking 'bout you trap (Shut the fuck up)
Back against the ropes, I still was swinging like a bat (Fah, fah, fah)
They like, "Why you call yourself the realest nigga?", I don't cap (You hear me)
Gangy dropped a four and now he leaning like a crooked smile (Shit, shit)
Oh no, I can never leave my brothers, I ain't Harry Styles (I can't)
Swear to God, I did it by myself like I'm the only child
Boy, my drip exclusive and my buffies white just like a cow
Damn, I'm sick as hell he let the choppa sing like Chaka Khan
On Miami Beach, I took the doors off the Rubicon
She just did some crazy shit, I'm looking down like, "You the one" (Goddamn)
You ain't got no drip, what do I look like beefing with a bum?
