Pop out that cut, nigga, pop up out that cut, nigga
Pop up out that cut like, "Give me that", ha
Pop out that cut, nigga, pop up out that cut, nigga
Pop up out that cut like— (Phew), ayy
Pop up out that cut like, "Give me that"
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Lil' brodie scammed a store, I'm sauced up, ravioli
My heart is so-so cold, who got a Chrome jacket for me?
I'ma be in GRAMMY votin', or I'm winning scammer trophies
Audemar Piguet with the VVS, I skipped past the Rollie
I'ma hustle until that casket on me
I'ma double, triple (Brr), quadruple every bag up on mе
Talkin' 'bout drank, it's gallons on me
Totin' them lil' ass Glockies, boy, it's .50 cal' up on mе
This .50 cal' up on me
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Pop up out that cut like, "Give me that", ha
Pop out that cut, nigga, pop out that cut, nigga
Pop up out that cut like, "Give me that", ha
Pop out that cut, nigga, pop up out that cut, nigga
Pop up out that cut like, "Give me that", ha
Pop out that cut, nigga, pop up out that cut, nigga
Pop up out that cut like, "Give me that", ha
Pop out that cut, nigga, pop up out that cut, nigga
