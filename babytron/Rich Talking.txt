[Intro]
(
Helluva made this beat, baby
)
(
If you ain't got a beat from Bam, you don't trap enough
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I ain't askin' you to tip your hat (Nope)
We got every weight class, come and pick your match (Come on)
Bitch got an attitude, like hold on, fix your act
How the fuck is you a vintage pourer, never sipped no Act'?
You ain't really into fast shit, you never drift no 'Cat
We know that lil' Charger, better go and tint your Scat
GRB enhancement in effect, I bet I get right back
O-double-S-L-T, on some shit like that
On some shit like that
GRB enhancement in effect, I bet I get right back
O-double-S-L-T, on some shit like that
On some shit like that, on some shit like that
[Verse 2: Babyfxce E]
Pull up in the 'Cat, they like, "Damn, I want some shit like that"
Gave Saks Fifth
five thousand so my 'fit like that (Nigga)
I threw a switch on the Glock, that's why it spit like that
He was bein' a class clown on the 'net, the chop dismissed his ass
Forgot the Glock up at the crib, I'm finna stick his ass
My nigga got more shit up out the pot than a Brillo pad
I got my shit and put it up, you would've spent your bag
I went to drop some shit for my bitch with her expensive ass
