[Verse]
Jack Man, I can’t wait till the 11 drop
Made twenty in New York, feel like Kevin Knox
Dick sucking but you broke, boy, you better stop
And if the credit DC, I bet the debit pop
Bitch, I’m really in my bag
Got the secret recipe, I feel like Mr. Krabs
Throw a bullet at yo ass, tryna throw a jab
Bitch, I crack cards, you won't catch me in no lab
Feeling like I was born to jugg
Made four and then I made two,
feel like Dugg
I'm the
socket
now, I used to look for the plug
Bitch talking us but I ain't got no love
Sleaze ball, I'm a cheater and a liar now
Asking how to swipe? Better go ask FireFox
(Dummy)
Only time I'm not out of town is if my tire pop
Good .40 stick, it’ll fuck up the entire block
Bitch balling, she could've went to
UConn
One of a kind, bitch, it ain’t two Trons (It ain’t)
Paid full price for the kicks, fuck a coupon
Choosing off the fit but this some lil' shit I threw on
G-O-A-T, yes, bitch, that’s me, that's probably why they hate me
Looking at the fit, you can tell I'm AP
But we know yo shit declined so don't try to play me
Coach Tron calling plays, I’m not Popovich
The sliders ain’t up, really I just got a gift
Jammed three times, grabbed the bag then I gotta dip
Dunking with this .9, on some Andre Iguodala shit
Won't catch me out, I make money while I’m chilling
Aiming for the stars, bitch, I been past the ceiling
Just made a play today, you wouldn't know the feeling
Powered up like Marvel but I'm jugging like a villain
You worried 'bout the strike, you ain't thinking bout the spare
Jumped in the deep end, wasn't thinking 'bout no air
Pulled her tracks out, I wasn't thinking 'bout her hair
You would never get no money 'cause you thinking like you scared
Ask bro, I used to bust ass on the court
But now I don’t hoop, I jugg dummies as a sport
Now I'm blessed, wake up and I thank the Lord
And if you ain't getting money, what you living for?
In Walmart doing my dance 'cause the chip pop
You gon' slip tryna walk behind this drip-drop
Breath taker on my side, I refuse to get got
Bro'll turn into Billups, hit you with a big shot
Road running, ain’t no time for a pit stop
Feel Sandy Cheeks, I'll pull up with a big chop
Neiman's love me now, I used to get it from the thrift shop
Went from Fila slides to double G’s on the flip flops
I got my balance right, I was tripping over hoes
Feeling like Usain, how I'm dipping to the Pros
You see that lil' button? If I click it then you gone
Four hunnid dollar shirt, bitch, I’m dripping in Vlone
Thinking that he Steve Jobs off of two jacks (Lame)
Used to do Burlington, now I do Saks
Hoes used to ho me, now they like, "Who that?"
Glock kinda strong, run up on me and get blew back
MMA work, punches fucking up the web
Alaskan crab, I got butter hanging off the leg
She swallow dick now, I used to get left on read
Got workers working while I'm chilling in a bed
Feeling like a wizard, I’m a 101 magician
Poof, he outta there, I left his ass missing
I really am the GOAT, boy, you just gotta listen
Look up "Jugg Messiah", bitch, I’m the definition
