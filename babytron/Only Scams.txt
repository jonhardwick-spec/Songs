[Verse 1: BandGang Javar]
My niggas got the wave, Pirates of the Caribbean
They think I'm scamming EBT everybody eatin' (big money)
I'd probably have a couple M's, if I wasn't beefing
Spendin' all the money finding out where niggas sleeping
Spray them up and they don't die, my opps like roaches
Even if it take my whole life, they know I'm gon smoke em
Y'all lucky PPP been my main focus
Tell em shoot, that's what happened, I'm the one coaching
Fuck a 9 to 5, this what that bank shit get you (facts)
We gon get thirty years and 30k off every victim (facts)
Couple fakе IDs, hundred phones in the rеntal (yeah)
[?] I got a [?]
I got fake Roxys, off the dark web
Mixed em in with the real ones, nigga couldn't tell
Hit em with the Fentanyl so they still sell
I can't give the pill site out, cause niggas gon tell
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
201s, 101s, I'm jamming chips or sliding tracks
Three-five of Turtle Pie, won't never catch me light a Black
Running off at dark? Got the flash, we'll find his ass
Shopping till I drop, I might fuck around and die in Saks
OT in the rental grabbing giffies but I'm flying back
OT in the rental, that's the only time you drive a Scat
If my hellhounds don't like yo vibe then they might attack
Fuck a ten, I need a dub
Fuck a dub, I need a fifty
Fuck a fifty, fuck a hunnid, lil' bitch, I need a milli'
Send me up to God? I'm shooting back so you gon' meet him with me
Camouflage Tech in yo bushes, I don't need a ghillie
Me and Rose in our Crocs, on our way to scoop some jacks
Ride around in whips like they cheetahs, catch us zooming 'Cats
Bloomingdale, Saks, Neiman Marcus, I done blew a stack
PPP,  if you ain't hip, better Google that
You make my head hurt, how you broke with all this pape' around?
Lil' pretty bitch, I'm off two tens, finna break her down
She used to block me at the rim but nowadays I'm banging out
Waitress recommended shrimp, I only want the steak for now
BandGang and ShittyBoyz, this that scam talk
Tiptoeing to the self-scan, this my jam walk
Need five figures if you want me, Dee, and Stan sauce
Don't let me catch you in my bag, gon' chop yo hands off
