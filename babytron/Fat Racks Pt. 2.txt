[Verse 1: Luh Tyler]
Skinny nigga, fat racks, stayin' the fuck up out the way (Gang)
White Runtz inside my blunt, that bitch burnin' like some sage
No, I ain't doing shit for you if that shit don't get me paid
Bad bitch, she got her toes done and her edges slayed
I'm on the beat, I'm in that mode, nigga, you can't stop the rain
Make sure that my family straight before I ever buy a chain (On gang)
In the booth, my feet kicked up, I'm kissin' Mary Jane (Out my body)
You won't catch me in the mix, I'm stayin' in my own lane
You won't catch me in the mix, but you can catch me with your bitch (With ya bitch)
Nah, this ain't dirty money, all my money be legit (My shit legit)
In the booth, I'm smoking Sour Patch, feeling like that kid (Like that kid)
I just took a nigga bitch, yeah, I hit her with that rizz (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm feeling like a pimple 'cause I'm finna pop my shit
If you ever took my ho, it ain't no pressure 'bout that bitch
Ain't no gas inside his blunt, buddy must be smokin' mid
You ain't tryna get no money, you ain't standin' on no biz
Take a look inside my pocket, I got racks inside my pants
I been gettin' to that money, nigga, feelin' like that man (Feel like the man)
Take your bitch and get behind her, yeah, then I do my dance (Yeah)
Time to have them labels callin', nigga, tryna get them bands
Nah, I don't fuck with niggas, you might think I'm in the Klan
Run that my money up, make sure my family straight, yeah, that's the plan
I ain't have to take your bitch, turned your ho into a fan
Take the ho out to the beach, she gettin' freaky on the sand
Pennywise inside my blunt, hit that shit, it make you float
I'm out the way, I'm with your bitch and she tryna drive the boat (Drive the boat)
I'm either out here chasin' cake or talkin' shit up in the 'yo (I'm in the 'yo)
I can't wait to rock the stage, you know I'm tryna kick the door
Rubi Rose or Jayda Wayda, man, fuck it, I want both
Had to cut lil' mama off because she always do the most
I been kissin' Mary Jane, think I'm 'bout to overdose
I been steppin' on they neck, I got the rap game in a choke
