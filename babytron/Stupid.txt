[Intro: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
(
Fuck the fire, we got grease
)
Boy
[Chorus: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
You don't wanna get me started, I can go for days
She gave me neck and it was fire, I did the David Blaine
Man, I don't know what y'all on, I'm just tryin' to get paid (
It's BlueStrip, baby
)
I made a hundred with the plug, he ain't even know my name
Nigga, I'm stupid, I'm always finna do what I'm gon' do
Man, niggas stupid, my bitch bad, she wouldn't say a word to you
I be in the mall just like the hood and I ain't never heard of you
Nigga, I'm stupid, you really stupid if you think I'm talkin' to you
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Fuck some Tris, I'm finna take some Wock' and turn my Sprite dirty
I might pop two tens, but I don't really like thirties
With the GlockBoyz, wе got some Glocks, boy, you ain't fight worthy
Clear water out of Hutch, why thе fuck your ice blurry?
Goose coat, Mike Amiri jeans off the Diors
Chopstick with the broomstick like I sweep floors
Why the fuck you only tough on the keyboard?
I-75 road running, hitting detours
[Verse 2: GlockBoyz TeeJaee]
Man, burn a block down, hit the airport, then the mall after that
Man, I just touched down in my state, I call your bitch like, "Where you at?"
I'm in the airport tucking money, I got fifty of them racks
Unless I'm booking her a ticket, she'll never know where I'm at
Two hundred hundreds, a hundred fifties, I got so many dubs
Man, don't let a nigga make me mad, I promise I'll go and stretch somethin'
Man, hit a nigga with that K like I was texting him or somethin'
Niggas think I'm rich right now, boy, just wait 'til the summer
Boy
