[Intro: OhGeesy]
My baby, that's my dog, that's my nigga, ayy (
He on X games mode
)
My baby, that's my dog, that's my nigga, ayy
[Chorus: OhGeesy]
My baby, my dog, that's my nigga, ayy
My baby, my dog, that's my nigga, ayy
My baby, my dog, that's my hitter, ayy
My baby, my dog, that's my hitter, ayy
Go best friend, that my best friend, ayy
Go best friend, that my best friend, ayy
My baby, my dog, yeah, my nigga, ayy
My baby, my dog, yeah, my hitter, ayy
[Verse 1: OhGeesy]
My baby, my dog, that my bro
Hundred packs of that motherfuckin' dro
Talk to my mans, I ain't dealin' with no ho
Get that motherfuckin' money off that floor
I'm throwin' hunduns on the stripper pole
Drop a pin, then we pullin' up with poles
Ice on, bitch, you know a nigga cold
Couple bags when I'm leavin' out the store
Quarter brick, what I'm cookin' on that stove
If the feds catch me, I don't know
I don't fuck with snitch niggas, that's for sure
I fuck with credit card scammers and some hoes, ayy
