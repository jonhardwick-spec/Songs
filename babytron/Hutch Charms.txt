[Intro]
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
(
Getta Beats
)
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
[Chorus: BabyTron]
I can make a move sitting down, telekinesis
Exotic 'bows touch down, boy, I sell them, not keep them
Y-3 Glocky, I'll send him to hell in Adidas
It ain't no ordinary Cat Piss, boy, you smelling the Cheetah
At the mall open to close, call me Paul Blart
So many sticks up in this shit, the whip a golf cart
Jumped up in the field too quick, they called a false start
Bitches on my dick, like, "What you pay Huch for that dog charm?"
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Cup full of kickstand, bitch, I'm leaning
I can go and make some quick bands, then spend that shit in Neimans
You gon' end up in some quicksand, acting like a demon
I'm so fuckin' high, gon' fly to Venus
I'm so motherfuckin' fly, Gelato, G7
You ain't got no real kit, neck hollow, cheap pendant
I play chess, not checkers, keep guessing
I told God I'm triple grateful for today, caught three blessings
Popped an Oxy', popped a molly
Brodie turnt, he tryna drop a body
Two-wheelin', I'm tippin' over, treat it like a Kawasaki
Double cuppin', top it with a Perky, this is not a Jolly
Yeah, this shit not rocket science
Hundred baby Drakeys, we are not with ISIS
Only cop the finest, we don't drop the prices
