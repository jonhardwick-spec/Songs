[Intro: TrDee]
(Enrgy made this one)
(Brr)
Blah-blah-blah
[Chorus: TrDee]
Blah-blah-blah, shut the fuck up
Oh, you took a L? Nigga, so what? (So?)
Opp got dropped, time to pour up (Ah)
Bitch act her shoe size, need to grow up (Eugh)
I got me a new pack, it's time to roll up (Ha, ha)
How the fuck are you a scammer? You ain't never load up
I think it's crazy how she hop on top of it and go nuts (Ayy, ayy)
Heard the song you dropped last week, you for sure suck
Weak-ass
[Verse 1: TrDee]
She don't post her nigga, you can always send a shot at her
In the Hellkitty, I'm just tryna make her kitty purr (Whew, whew, whew, whew)
Saw her in another nigga likes, I know yo feelings hurt
You might think we fighting 'til you getting popped just like a Perc' (Grrah)
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Hеad nod to my shooter, that's the okie-dokiе
Cuddy dancing on the work, he damn near did the Hokey Pokey
Took his watch and had him curling up, shit, that's a rollie pollie
(Shit)
Cathedral ceilings in the crib, shit, holy moley
Skating in the ZO1, might fuck around and tre flip it
Snatch the horns up off a buffalo, I'm in here weight lifting (Weight lifting)
Guava Gelato to the brain, I feel my face twitching
Why the fuck he reach for the chain? He must be 'caine sniffing
20K in plastic if we talking 'bout my jugg days
Brown Louis sneakers, match the Drakey with the wood grain
All this stepping, need to damn rest, I got some foot pain
Life not a game, you can't choose when you push play
(Where the opps at?)
