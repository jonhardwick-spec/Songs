[Intro]
Yeah
Lemme tell you sum, real life type shit (
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
[Hook]
It ain't nothing like a real bitch
Unky always told me it ain't nothing like them field trips
I can show you 'bout them bands, ain't never pill flip
Hutch water, with the lights off, bitch, I'm still lit
Shoes soo woo but my pockets still Crip
Two new tools, brodie tryna drill shit
Huh, and that's just how it is and that's just what it is
[Verse 1]
I remember I ain't have a slug in my pocket
I remember I ain't have a plug or a socket
Bro seen a opp out, he finna jump out and drop it
Turtle Pie, finna fill my lungs up with something toxic
That's really just to kill the pain
Dick sucking, I don't even know you, boy, you really lame
Dub show on my neck, don't talk about no dilly chain
Cut her her off quick, I just told her I don't feel the same
It's some wounds that never heal but I don't let them phase me
Used to walk so when I'm in the coupe, I push the pedal crazy
Got some youngins out here jamming chips, the others selling eighthies
I look up sometimes 'cause he blessed your baby
Walking in my shoes? You gon' find out my life a movie
Always arguing with my bitch but I like 'em bougie
High as hell at Beni's eating steak, shrimp, rice, and sushi
High as hell with my white boys, finna light a doobie
All odds against me but I made it out
They ain't see the vision, whole time was on the paper route
Same time you sleep, got a chef bringing bacon out
Hit your baby mama in your crib and I stained the couch
Used to load the Bitcoin with like a hunnid dollars
Now how I'm feeling, bitch, I'm headed towards a hunnid commas
Called dukes up and told her, "It's my summer, mama"
You should take the cuffs off that bitch, she got a running problem
