I don’t know the price on the lobster gotta ask the market
Early in the AM I’m riding in an Aston Martin
Twitter hacked, if you bought a feature boy you half retarded
Some days it feel like everybody hating
Everybody round you snake, everybody faking
DSM charm on the way, you know that Hunchy made it
You was chasing hoes I was out money chasing, left them with the funny face
I just left Hollywood the show it was sold out
Offensive lineman, you ain't running no routes
Yeah I used to be a rookie I'm the pro now
I'm GOAT now and they don’t know how
Unky charged up off the beans like they senzus
Shit, he over 9000
In the club turnt shitty charm off the test tubes
Mike Amiri's I might throw a dime out em
Goose with the fur shit I look Norwegian
Ima spend at least a 5 ball step foot in Neiman's
Nike tech, Nike tech its the jugging season
They was Ray Charles to the vision guess they couldn’t see it (that's unfortunate)
Had that chicken on me in the 84 I hit Hattie B's
You a turn around and miss the shot like you Swaggy P
4 wocky got me wobbling round like its Happy Feet
100 rounder cooked dog like he got ashy knees
Ima stick to the skinnies why you got on saggy jeans
Got a stick in my skinnies don’t make me grab the heat
I'm just winning I don’t give a fuck if they mad at me
Tell em grab a seat
In my angel eye you can catch me rolling loud
I might hop on stage without a mic and just blow a pound
Talkin bout the plug, I a hoe you, you ain't sold an ounce
Hoppin out the coupe, Roscoe Dash bitch I'm showing out
Why you always talking bout shit you don’t know about
How I get a scuff on these kicks I gotta throw em out
GTA lifestyle I'm just roaming round
It get cold where Im at that’s why the coat a thou
Dont be surprised if I end up XXL
Gotta cut em off the team that’s another test failed
Two packs of woods, three good and the rest stale
Why you gotta bag I think you praying on your next sale
Inhale, exhale I see the stress leave my body
So many horses in the whip I feel like Kemosabe
High as hell, by 3 o clock poured a 3 of wocky
Chop on me, and hell nah I ain't finna eat hibachi
Shooter pull em up and drop em off shit he think he Bruce
Doin 160 I might die tryna swing the coupe
2022 type shit don’t need a key to use
Megatron on the way im finna leave em spooked
