[Intro]
(
Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Marni head to toe, I'm fuzzy than a bitch like Mike Wazowski
That shit turn me lion-hearted, everyone who tried to doubt me
Punches, they on fire like volcanoes, caught a flight to Maui
Put some doggy on his head, my shooter tryna find the bounty
[Verse 2: AK Bandamont]
I serve the baseheads, I got white around me
At granny house, I'm steppin' on cocaine, this shit white and cloudy
Bro short, but he be dunkin' on the opps, look like Mike Lowry
My white bitch be knockin' hoes out, she look likе Ronda Rousey
[Verse 3: BabyTron &
AK Bandamont
]
Got a wild bitch, hop on top, ride it like a Kawasaki
Got a bitch who feed mе, like her pills, she always poppin' molly
With BabyTron, the hoes pullin' out phones, it look like paparazziMy fiend called, she said she finna come get a fix, she tryna cop the molly
If you don't hit the pharm' and grab a pint, I bet we squabble [?]
Just know we got it all, if you ever need some dog, you better call me, auntie
Militia ties, I send a hit, they call me on a walkie-talkie
I visualized a hundred thousand all blues and now I got it on me
His Rollie's tickin' like an itchy dog, can tell his watch is phony
My finger itchin', if I see somethin' that's off, just know I'm callin' brodie
Doin' random rights and lefts, was paranoid the law was on me
Yeah, you right I like to flex, shoot the ball like Kobe
Fiend callin' askin' 'bout some dog, he sent the paw emoji
