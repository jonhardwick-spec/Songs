[Intro: BabyTron]
Live from the Lab
What's the fucking deal, Bando? You know what the fuck goin' on
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
(
Danny G on the beat
)
(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Lookin' for someâ€”, I ended up on Daisy Lane
Took a razor, left the blade bald-headed, Lady Jane
Would've thought his pistol modded, brodie got some crazy aim
Why you out here tryna merge in mine? It's like eighty lanes
More water on my neck than the aquarium
Two chops, Kane and Undertaker, finna bury 'em
Put the scams down, I thought I'd marry 'em
SKS, shoot it from my chest, Shawn Marion
Off the juice spittin' flames, call the fire station
They was deep sleepin' on me like a hibernation
Now they know BabyTron through the entire nation
Back-to-back V10s, we in some Vipers racin'
Get a chance and take it
Fly as hell, but I'm finna try and land the spaceship
Shit, I'm hangin' with some aliens
Play with us and knock the thoughts out his cranium
[Verse 2: J1Hunnit]
Green tip bullet can penetrate through Vibranium
You can tell I push weight, my chest jigglin' like Dame and them
Put the squeeze on a kid, he think his balls are titanium
I walked in with two hoes on me like Pinky
I can spot a whore quick, her weave look crinkly
She did a thousand dicks in her time like Pinky
I told her get her bag up some more and she can link me
I like hoes that got a lot to bring to the table
I been lookin' for a stallion I can bring to the stable
I don't sell dreams, I ain't good at tellin' fables
I can promise you I bring the bacon home if I'm able
