(
Marc Boomin, this you?

[Chorus: YSR Gramz]
When that pack touch down, tax like Uncle Sam
When we shooting, we ain't putting niggas on cam
I don't fuck with these niggas, no, you not my mans
I got that V up on my back 'cause I ain't got no friends
When that pack touch down, tax like Uncle Sam
When we shooting, we ain't putting niggas on cam
I don't fuck with these niggas, no, you ain't my mans
I got that V up on my back 'cause I ain't got no friends
[Verse 1: YSR Gramz]
Yeah, 'cause I ain't got no friends
I'm riding with my niggas till the world ends
Nigga sneak dissing? Put that barrel to his fucking head
I'm smoking weed, getting head, tryna go to bed
My nigga tryna slide right now, my nigga off the meds
I tried to tell my lil' nigga chill,  they sent him to the feds
My lil' cousin playing with the chop, he almost hurt himsеlf
If nobody got my back then I got myself
I was really brokе, now I'm [?]
I got the [?] on my back, tryna catch myself
Hold on, let me catch myself
Treat you one of you niggas like my kid and beat you with a belt
You out here tryna fuck lil' bitches, you gon' go to jail
I'm out of town, I sent it to myself, bro, catch the mail
We screaming [?] when we see 12
It don't take much, lil' nigga, just be yourself
Me and my lil' brother [?]
Nigga, ain't nobody make me, I made myself
I heard some niggas on yo head, you better fake yo death
This 'Wood hitting hard as hell, I can't catch my breath
