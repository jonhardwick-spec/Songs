[Intro]
(
Enrgy made this one
)
Fuck, shit, man
Stop saying free me, I got out the next day, manThat's a broke problem, I was not sitting in that bitch
ShittyBoyz, Dog $hit Militia
[Verse]
They caught me out in Nebraska with a controlled substanceInnocent until I'm proven guilty, I don't know nothingCouldn't stop the road running, hit Milwaukee next day
Certified just showed me how to break a brick, we senseis
Worried if I'm locked up? Make sure that your rent paid
All my mans around me fresh like next year we in tenth grade
Must've hear I signed the spot-up shooter to a ten-day
Tried to be heroic, now he Tony Stark in Endgame
It ain't shit to say, gon' let my lawyer talk
Spot still banging down the way, you need boy or
gâ€”
Told the cops that they some workers, can't employ a boss
Triceps in my glasses, you would think it's 'roids I'm off
They say I got a founding father name, my pocket full of 'em
My cuddy in the kitchen with some chickens, gnawing and cooking 'em
It's belt-to-ass season, if I spot an opp, we whooping
him
Medusa did the chains, gon' be stone if you stop and look at 'em
[Chorus]
Out on bond, out on bond, shit, I'm out on bond
Hunnid shots, two hunnid shots for all y'all tried to clown on Tron
King of the galaxy like come on, time to crown the Don
All the buckets that I dropped, I'm on the list around LeBron
Out on bond, out on bond, shit, I'm out on bond
Shit, I call the shots, left the county, hit the mall to shop
Tried to count me out, the calculator said you ought to stop
I'm out on bond, riding with the Drac', ducking law, I'm hot
Tweaking with the prices, type of shit to get the plug dropped
Caught a hater out, I'm finna take my second mugshot
(Caught a hater out, I'm finna take my second mugshot)
