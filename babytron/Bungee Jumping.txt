[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Aw shit, I could come through, talk shit, walk drip
Took a loss once but I'm never off, bitch
All bricks, turn 'em in, now just watch me ball, bitch
I'm the chosen one, I ain't lying, that's the fucking truth
Took a lil' jump off the porch, now I jump in coupes
Fell off, bounce back, I'm a bungee jumper, dude
High as hell, got the munchies, yeah, I'm finna punch some food
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Look, dummy, I'm a scam master
Flip arounder on this bitch, I'll knock his ass backwards
Five hour road trip, I'm floating up to Grand Traverse
Spilling steak sauce on Dior, where's my damn manners?
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Wipe a nigga nose then I'm fucking on his bitch
Be a couple months before the Rollie on my wrist
Got some more choppеrs for the niggas throwing fits
I been running through the hoes likе a nigga called a blitz
I'm a big flexer, middle finger to you niggas hating
Catching plays, getting cake, you the nigga caking
Ask what Tr is, you the nigga faking
Going state to state with slides, nigga, what you taking?
You a demon, oh shit, girl, I'm finna nut
My white bitch wanna know if I could punch a butt
She ain't down to do the team then she out of luck
Niggas want beef but be dodging like a fucking truck
