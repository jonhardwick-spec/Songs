[Intro: TrDee]
Huh
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Fell asleep with my chain on, woke up with a crooked neck
Life just like a game but you know you cannot hit reset
I'll pull my pants down, baby, you can do the rest
Number one rule with this shit, that you cannot confess
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Tron just walked in high as hell, with his giggly-ass
I like all my hoes with deep throats and a jiggly ass
Talk shit till my breath stank, where the Wrigley's at?
Profile fire, BIN punch, finna get me a jack
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Five hunnid dollar BAPE hoodie straight out Loose Cannon
Comfy than a bitch in BOA, I'm in my Goose scamming
Crab legs, shrimp, and some steak, I don't do salmon
Flyer than a pelican, can catch me on yo roof landing
[Verse 4: TrDee]
Feel like Giannis for the bucks, I'm flying down the lane
I be hanging with gorillas and they can't be tamed
I do know a couple freaks but they can't be named
Why the fuck you hate the player? I ain't make the game
