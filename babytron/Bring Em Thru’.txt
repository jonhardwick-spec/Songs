[Verse]
PGA tour, cross the country with some sticks on (Brrt-brrt)
You talking 'bout some old shit, I'm hip brodie
Blicky with the switchy, if I aim it, I won't miss homie (Phew)
Fifties with some Nipseys, got about a hunnid strip on me (Brrt)
That's a big bag
Shit, I heard the haters mad, it's finna get bad
Granny in her ShittyBoyz hoodie with her hip-ass
First class, I ain't fucking with the skip lag
Been had twenty back in school, that's why I skipped class
In that big body, finna drift past (Skrrt)
Been in the deep for so long, could teach a swim class (Splash)
Unky getting pounds off, ain't no SlimFast
I might pop all up with half a ticket, with my rich ass
Boy, you don't wanna go to war, no, you ain't got that (You ain't got that)
Boy, you finished, Mortal Kombat (Finished)
Fell down and got back, they can't stop that
Brodie banging like a Slasher looking for some contacts (Pfft, pfft)
(It's been aâ€”) It's been a lil' minute, still don't give a damn
Newest generation Glocky, I don't think it's finna jam (Brrt)
I been off the porch forever, shit, I been a man (Shh)
Shit, you been a ham (Shh)
