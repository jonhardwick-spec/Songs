[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Ayy, Clover, what up?
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bro got a mask on, no Coronavirus
Bitch can't get a ring like her phone on silent
I'm in love with the jacks, you the GOAT, Verizon
Big drip, all splash, I don't know Poseidon
[Verse 2: Chuckie CEO]
Aye, running to that money, I be speeding
Big chop leave a fuck nigga bleeding
Ayy, my niggas out here shooting for no reason
In that cell, I was talking to them demons
Out the way, say, I'm finna ball all season
Ayy, wipe a nigga nose like a fever
I'm a pastor on the mic, I be preaching
Give 'em 50-50 out this Drac', we even
[Verse 3: Skilla Baby]
Fiend OD, OT tryna overdrive
You ain't bring shit from OT but coronavirus
Young niggas like to smack niggas for no reason
I can sеnd a nigga up to God, I know demons
The opp niggas dead, wе not, the score even
In the trap, if I see an opp, ain't no leaving
Dog wearing fake J's, them DeAndres
My nigga Chuckie, he a CEO, this ain't
Child's Play
