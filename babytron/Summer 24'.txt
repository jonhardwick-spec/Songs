[Intro]
(
Jose the Plug
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
[Chorus]
Shit, it's summertime, of course the block scorching
White tee, designer jeans, I might rock Forces
Gang pulled up double-cupped up, Wock'-pouring
Brodie slid through GLE, he just drop foreigns
I was up as early as the roosters, you should stop snoring
Life a movie, you should watch it while you popcorn-ing
Thumbing blues made me a monster, I can't stop scoring
Get the bag and power slam that bitch just like Bob Orton
[Verse 1]
Back in school, I had F's, plus I was insubordinate
Now they spinning on the tires, every single foreign whip
Always talked my lil' shit, now I'm recording it
Thirty Slapwoods in rotation, got a forest lit
Arе you a Jedi or a rapper? You just forcing it
I've been playеd out the Georgia trips, I'm heading north with it
Another obstacle to hurdle, 'nother door to kick
Ever went for the first down and been short a inch?
Damn near died a couple times, I guess I'm lucky
Population less than a hundred, bro out in West Kentucky
Huh, said you never seen me scamming, but that's 'cause by the time you went in store, I was sending dummies
Deep in my bag, geeked up, get deep in my thoughts
You ain't live what I lived, seen what I saw
Red or purp' what I sip, green when it's fraud (ShittyBoyz, long life $cam, phew)
