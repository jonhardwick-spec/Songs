[Part I: Circo Loco]
[Verse]
Catching up impossible, you on a wild goose chase
Cuddy laying prone with the fully so he shoot straight (Brrt)
I done overdid the Quagen, now my tooth ache
Being optimistic, in my mind I'ma be too great
Manifested everything that ever came to me
Turking forty, split the pint two ways, face the eighth a piece
Mister Go Get It, I'm on everything from A to Z (That shit in me, not on me, ShittyBoyz)
It's dinner 2023, these Marnis, not no Diors
I never have a seven digit likе because you think poor
Buffs on vanilla, bitch caramel, and my weed S'morеs
If you catch me sleep daytime, that's a lean snore
You a bot, shit, your game must be CPU
If I was you, I understand, I'd want to be me too
They don't see it, wonder how it feels from the Stevey view
All we did was go to school together, why you think we cool?
Bro'll pitch the bag or take a hit, he like Shohei Ohtani
Fetty serving, unc' ain't Jeffery Dahmer when he make a zombie
Long woofing on that road, you ain't play no commie
How the fucks it feel that everything you do, you paste and copy?

Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, yeah, yeah, yeah
