[Intro]
(It's Hokatiwi)
(Yeah, turn it up, Chang)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
Barcelona
Barcelona gang, yeah
Gang Barcelona, foreign, when we kick it
Yeah, bitch, yeah, okay, yeah
[Verse]
Gang Barcelona, foreign sneaks when we kicking it
Riding 'round like the Men in Black, we equipped with blicks
And it's a laser beam on it, I ain't missing shit
Unc' acrobatic on that block, catch him flipping 'scripts
Cracking black cards, boy, I think these bitches limitless
Five years, I ain't seen him but I heard he still a bitch
I ain't get a thang off yo plate, I ain't splitting shit
Get rich or die trying, bitch can't get fifty cent
Shit, she can't get a penny
Drop a pint of Wockhardt, I ain't spilling Henny
Lil' freaky bitch off a Perc'? Shit, it's getting messy
You playing with that sack in the field, we would've blitzed already
Fuck a field goal, I want the whole six
I don't want the bitch if she can't eat the whole dick
When you in the field, young dawg, you gotta tote sticks
Hopped out the Lamb', had that bitch on some, "Woah" shit
Off the Runtz, I'm like, "Oh, shit"
No heart but my T-shirt on some Chrome shit
Unky said he finna work magic if the stove lit
I just spent 20K on a rose gold kit
Fucked around and made ten off a parlay
Nuts on her face, treat the bitch like a parfait
I'ma shine out for every single one them dark days
Shit was really easy but they say I took the hard way
Down in L.A. with a stick, feeling like Ohtani
Scam this, scam that, I feel like I'm Kwame
Tryna slide and kill a hundred opps, feeling like a Nazi
Off a four, walking 'round looking like a zombie
Casamigos type bitch, she walk around drunk and sloppy
Told my bitch I'ma kill her if she spill a cup of Wocky
7.62s, guarantee that they puncture bodies
Hitman on speed dial 'cause he love them bounties
Huh, Drip God, need a roll about me
Bitch heard that I rap, tryna get a roll up out me
She wanna talk but it ain't shit to know about me
Bitch ask for a single thing? Get a "No" up out me
You telling hoes "Yes" like you Daniel Bryan
Rap star but I came up off of jam and sliding
Knew chemistry, gave a fuck about passing science
Touchdown, touchdown, someone pass the Heisman
Scammed dawg, now his balance minus
Out of town eating alligator, shit, I had to try it
Know he heard me in that widebody, thang passing by him
201, 101, shit, I'm back in sliding
ShittyBoyz
chain, two chains, bitch know it's me
Don't think this ever that, ain't no ho in me
No doors on that gladiator, finna float the Jeep
Usually the White Runtz but right now I'm blowing Pink
