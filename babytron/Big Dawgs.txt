[Verse 1: StanWill]
(Whew)
Rockin' Christian in the Demon, I feel like a sinner
Hutch threw all these trophies on my neck, bitch, I feel like a winner
Got that chicken on me, your bitch eat me every night for dinner
I should throw a leash up on your bitch the way I dog her
On that MSR, done wrote more Visas than an author
Rockin' all this Christian, should be preachin' on the altar
All that fuckin' wave ridin', bet we sink him in the water
Tippie-toes say 43, the Glocky hold 'bout thirty-four
Walk him down, we get up close on opps and score like first and goal
Made a hundrеd thousand off a laptop like I work from home
What brodie smokin' loud as fuck, I swеar I think I heard the 'bow
I won't rock it, it ain't Ksubi, Mike, Purple
Off a pint of yeah, we turnin' every Sprite purple
Pushin' up the buffies, I look like Urkel
Fire on my waist, you think you reachin' for my ice, burn you
Double coffee cup, it ain't no cappuccino in me
He got lost up in that water like he Nemo in it
I brought new jacks to the city, I'm like Nino in it
Ain't nobody testifyin' 'cause brodie, he ain't leave no witness
[Verse 2: Tommy G]
Knock-knock, who's that? It's me with the pack
Now I'm in the trap with Certified Trapper
I done see two G's turn into fifty racks
Guaranteed I got the shit that break your baby momma's back
Big dogs gotta eat like, "Woof"
When you speak on me, you better say the truth
I'm the big dog prodigy, yo, I gotta be
And I'm signin' off, yo, it's Tommy G
