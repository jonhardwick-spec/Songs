[Verse]
(That ain't shit though, I ain’t do this shit)
Hey
City boys
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I’m seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope
No español, I'm allergic to rojo and legally blind, all I'm seein' is "go"
D to the A, there and back, if we ride with the Drac', can't smoke from the T to the O
Upped than a bitch, you can keep what you owe
Granny told me, "Boy, you reap what you sow"
Do the most, we over-even the score
Said he on the run, glued his feet to the floor
Up in my Tesla, I’m rollin’ up 'Ishers, I stopped at Valero, think I should quit smokin’
Life is a gamble and I'm playin' slots, pull it down, close my eyes and I pray I win tokens
Aye, aye, aye
How long was that?
