Dog $hit Militia, up some pape', yeah

[Verse 1]
Dog $hit Militia, I could up the stick or up some pape'
If I hit a ramp in the 'Cat, can damn near jump a lake
I put my pain in this Wild Rum
, that's why I stuffed the eighth
I'll leave yo dukes' paycheck and truth and I'm still underage
I spent tuition on a Hutch chain and I dropped out of college
Riding 'round with gang, chop tucked in case we got a problem
Scam star, don't ask me 'bout no pots 'cause I am not around 'em
Same person you would pass it to can't gеt a lob up out me
Hardbodied, ten toеs, bitch, I'm solid to the grave
I fucked up the trust with my girl but promised I'll change
Brodie don't smoke, he got a baby bottle for the pain
Was rookie of the year two years ago then polished up my game
European sneakers, pull up shooting shit like Türkoğlu
The engine barking like a hellhound when I'm skrrting through
Bro'll pull up shooting shells out, off the turtle juice
The hoes can't peep the cap but I can see the perp in you
Feel like Bret Hart, hit the lil' bitch with a leglocker
You won't see a crease when I step, nah, these the dead stockers
Told my bitch we eating Eddie V's, like, fuck some Red Lobster
Ju tripping out the sun roof, that's my headshotter
7.62s twist his 'fro up, these some dreadlockers
Drawers fancy than a bitch, four hunnid on some red boxers
Titi fake some back pain and then it's to the next doctor
Ain't never sold a drug so it's shout-out to them check droppers
