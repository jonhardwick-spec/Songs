[Intro]
Awstria
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Charged up like I just popped a Senzu Bean
My shooter off four bars, that’s that LTE
[Verse 2: TrDee]
That card only hit for food, is it EBT?
Stan's pieces really slam like a DDT
[Verse 3: StanWill]
I'll let the chop sing, IceJJFish
Hit your lil' bitch first, on some Ray J shit
[Verse 4: 10kKev]
Blue and lime Amiris with the paint splatter
Brodie in the kitchen whipping pots like it's cake batter
[Verse 5: BabyTron]
Super fly in these Amiris, Fly Jimmy Snuka
Flex? Nah, I can’t even do fifty push-ups
Stand back 'cause bro Harden, he’ll really cook ‘em
[Verse 6: TrDee]
Pootie Tang with the belt, fuck around and whoop 'em
ShittyBoy like I always got diarrhea
Nigga’s claiming he ain’t broke, well I’m not either
