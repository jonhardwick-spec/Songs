[Intro: BabyTron]
Bitch, yeah
Swear to God

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I was bad as hell in school, you went to Bible study
Spilled a pint of Wocky on the chop and left the rifle muddy
If you ain't God, you ain't got the right to judge me
Code talking, scamming, told lil' bro come get them Tysons from me
That's a knockout, you at work finna clock out
Sliding with the heavy metal, banging, tryna rock out
Calling audibles, I got my wide-out on a hot route
Finish school but feel like I should've dropped out
I'm prolly saying that 'cause of what I got now
Thinking that you 12, every time you 'round, the cops out
It's a jack morning, shit, I'm finna bring the Crocs out
Used to be the window when I did it, I can shop now
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Know some niggas in they feelings, hurt to see us elevated
Seeing niggas winning motivate me, bitch, I never hated
Know a couple niggas that don't like me but won't ever say it
Beat the kitty up a couple times but I never ate it
It's not MyTEAM but my whole team can get a bucket
Slide down on a opp block and really cause a ruckus
I can show you pics from high school, I was really thrusting
Certain shit used to make me mad, now I just say fuck it
Always in my bag, never in my feels
Damn, this bitch cold, baby give me chills
Why the fuck you still saving hoes? You must work for S.H.I.E.L.D
Woke up tryna make some money, you tryna make a bill
