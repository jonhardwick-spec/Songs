[Intro]
It don't take shit to win but some focus
Phew, hey
(
Meech
)
[Verse]
It don't take shit to win but some focus
Your mind everywhere else, then you hopeless
Triple double in your city like I'm Jokić
Shrooms got me trippin', thought my shadow was an opp approaching
Clutch performer, boy, I wouldn't leave me open
I could have ten M's, they wouldn't notice
I could have a dollar to my name and they wouldn't even know it
'Cause what I learned is whatever's in your hand, you can't show it
She gon' give your ass the red light, for me, bet she going
Heavy on the manifesting where I'm at, feeling chosen
Was a dime, bought an ass,
now she eleven like DeRozan
Pocket full of Nipsey blues, sixty shots, catch me rolling
Floating, take my pain, then I pour it
Still'll go and get the bag while it's cold and it's snowing
While it's raining, while it's sunny, I'ma catch it if they throw it
Why you playing with my money? I'ma catch you if you owe me
I'ma leave 'em chili cheese fried, I catch them at the Coney
Heard you still ain't even seen five,
I'm smellin' a jabroni
Rollin' out the 'bow bag, you can smell I have it on me
With my twin, you can't tell who's who, Zack and Cody
It all started with a plan in my head
Layin' down, starin' at the ceiling fan in my bed
Took a leap of faith, ain't know where I'd land in the end
Get that boy around me if you wear a badge 'cause he fed
Gotta be ten toes if you gon' stand on my pegs
You ain't know me with the bowl cut or Stan with the dreads
So much horsepower, sounded like I crashed when I rev
It's a dirty game pressin', I'm like Pat to the bev'
Put his trust in a slut, should get smacked in his head
Ain't no way that they could hawk us in the Track' when we fled
If I get a loaf, brodie gettin' half of the bread
Road runnin' up them racks, caught a cramp in my leg
Got my phone in the other room, you know I'm freestyling
Cuddy cut it with the pills 'cause he tend to be violent
If they get me in that room, guarantee I—If they get me in that room, guarantee I be silent
I wonder if I wasn't who I was, who really'd be with me?
If you counted DSM out, know you feeling really silly
First class, heard you bookin' flights that got the hidden city
Stuffed a bitch in Cincinnati, send her down to Mississippi
Hidden action impact, four attachments, told 'em pistol grip me
If we catch 'em in that alley, guarantee he gettin' Ricky
If she eat this Perc 10, she gon' give the dick a hickey
We gon' test it out on doggy bone 'cause he a guinea piggy
Catch 'em at the G station, leave 'em in the chip aisle
I'm with MJ or 40 if I'm down on 6 Mile
If you don't get down, get your ass stripped down
Think you keepin' up with us, like, have you seen a fish drown?
