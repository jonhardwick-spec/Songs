[Intro: BabyTron &
Kasher Quon
]
Marc Boomin, this you?
Shooting at the opps out the whip, might hit a
Ayy, skrrt
Kasher QuonLet's go
(
Boomin need extras
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Shooting out the whip at the opps, might hit a bystander
Jugging hams at the Western Union, I feel like Kasher
Made her eat the dick and she can't spend the night after
Bitch talking 'bout buy her hair? I had to eyelash her
[Verse 2: Kasher Quon]
EDD still working, you gotta bypass it
I walk around with all blue cheese, I don't like [?]
Still flashing a band and all twenties? That's light though
The last nigga that tried to rob me was a jackrabbit
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Moonwalking off the Runtz like I'm Mike Jackson
Crack a joke about me? Swear to God you gon' die laughing
Throw a jab at me? Swear to God you gon' diе scrapping
Percocet from China, bitch, I'm blowed off a spikеd Fanta
[Verse 4: Kasher Quon]
I'll pour up in a Faygo, I don't like Fanta
I'll never smoke a cigarette, I don't like cancer
I told her, "We can fuck but you can't stay the night after"
Just poured bleach on a nigga skin, he Mike Jackson
