Hey, hey
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I decided war before my jeans did
Hall of fame badge around your bitch, I got elite rizz
She could never be my baby mama, this bitch eats kids
I told my lil' bro and them that they should dream big
Red tank can with yellow guts look like some Cheez Whiz
2024, gon' stop the Wock' but I'ma drink Tris
Top shelf terrorist, the plug'll never bring mids
Life gettin' real, I'm finna go and cop my dream crib
It's gettin' cold, Avirex off the Supreme Timbs
Suited and booted, boy, you know we got a mean biz
Catch him walkin' out the shop, give him a retwist
Catch him walkin' out the stu', the chop gon' drop a remix
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Run it up so fast, they think my life a simulation
Pull up UFO, abduct your wife into a spaceship
Higher than a mountain, got more ice than Himalayas
Pulled up on Militia tryna fight, got hit with lasers
Addin' blicks to the collection, tryna minus all my haters
They ain't talkin' 'bout no end, then I ain't signin' on no papers
Tryna clean a dispo out, we pulled up buyin' all the flavors
Every time I start the 'Kitty up, I frighten all my neighbors
I turned the nosebleeds to some floor seats
She done pulled up to the spot and left with sore knees
Me, Tron, Bando, Dee in buffies look like four geeks
Make her call me Mr. Mozzarella, I got more cheese
