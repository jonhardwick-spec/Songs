[Intro]
HBK Cheese
[Verse 1: Big Los]
Free Draco, he was a fool with the AR
We get to sliding, we gon' knock you off the radar
We in the Scat and we ain't in the trap
Send a SSN so Tron can make it happen
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Huh
Pushing PUAs straight through, I ain't into traffic
Touchdown, audible the play, this shit can get like Madden
I don't fight, Glock 23 make him poof like magic
Feel like Danny Phantom, work the 101 and then I vanish
[Verse 3: Big Los]
Tron into magic, he gon' make some shit vanish
Fake ID'd the bitch, now she think that I speak Spanish
Alright, this ain't Madden but we blitz
Blue tips smack his body, make him stiff
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Same table done boss around, we chopping on
I ain't have no chicken, me and gang was brеaking wish bones
We don't shoot houses but whеn we catch 'em, it's gon' hit home
We gon' knock the water out his tank, we catch him fish bowl
