Ooh, shit, what the fuck, Daniel?

It's BlueStrip, baby

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
AK wearin' ski goggles in the spot cuttin' ice
I can slide a rental out of Enterprise or punch a flight
If he scuff these new Dior kicks, send him up to Christ
I don't drink alcohol, but I'd love a Sprite
Too blowed, Lemon Cherry with some Pumpkin Spice
How I'm feelin', fuck around and go to Hutch tonight
Put that lil' dub away, you don't crunch, that's light
Akhi crazy, if he get up close, gon' have you duckin' knives
[Verse 2: AK Bandamont]
And have you duckin' pipes, I throw my gloves on when I be cuttin' white
Now life crazy, they send me out in public like, "You my cousin, right?"
Doggy bought a bag and got robbed, he wasn't hustlin' right
Hm, he might not make it to the morning, I brought a gun to fight
Doggy talkin' like he cut, he really a bitch, he just a bunch of hype
I brought girly to the crib, but I ain't pipe, I want tongue tonight
I left crib with the beam attached to the Glocky, can't run tonight
This bitch sober for a week and call my phone, she want drugs tonight
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
It's thirty for a verse, fifty for a show, I love this life
Best believe them bitches 'round if you don't see a gun in sight
Overdid the drank while I was drivin', now I'm runnin' lights
Buffies on my face, they Caucasian like a cup of rice
