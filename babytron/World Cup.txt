Lyrics from Snippet
[Verse]
...Abracadabra, [?] workin with the magic book
World champ, take my belt and give yo' ass a whoopin'
Countin' wing dings while I'm smokin' on banana pudding
Sensei with the scams, I done mastered jugging
Cuddy in the fast lane ready to crash out
Bitch, I got the ups, if I don't dunk, I bet I smack out
Dog pulled up when a bow wasn't a gram of loud
You would never know the sniper 'cause he play the background
Shit, it look like motor oil, bitch, we sip toxic
Mix the shrooms with the juice, that shit hypnotic
With the six, I got shit on lock, call me Ben Wallace
I was touching down in Tennessee back with Chris Johnson
Punch, punch, punch, punch, I got my bitch boxin'
Still ain't catch the whip? Can't relate, I'm goin' crib shoppin'
Told the worker, "You can't go home until the whip polished"
His Patek ain't do a dance, but it's tick-tocking
You ever woke up in the sky and fell asleep high?
All these missiles turned the TRX to a G5
Everybody rockin' goose coats, watch them geese fly
I was underwater in the deep, while you was knee high
If he on some bullshit, I gotta free ties
Used a CVV, I got it on the free side
If you looked inside this double cup, you'd think I drink wine
Shit, I'm so unfazed, I'mma sleep fine
I'm tryna stack it from the floor through the ceiling
Finna Karo doggy, all I gotta do is seal it
Doggy bone's right hand must be keyboard, cause he a mouse
Had to pinch myself, I'm livin' all the shit I dreamed about
Meet you on the rim like a slasher
Supreme sending new heat, I ain't buying Thrasher
On the wild west groovin', turn a right on Lasher
(Phew, aight, look)
Actin' like the big doggy, got his tail tucked
Streets cold, but they ain't colder than that jail, bud
He ain't seen zaza, roll him stale ones
Try and get in arms reach, you gon' fail, chump
