Whew, huh
Ha-ha-ha
[Verse]
My hitman got some photographic memory
Devin Booker, pull up on you, throw your ass to 70
Smelt it in the air before I smoked a pack of jealousy
Jefe ridin' with some rocks, he tryna juke a felony
Balmain to Amiri, never did I do embellished jeans
Said he seen a hundred, well he must be doing LSD
Opps weirdos, prolly meet up, do the human centipede
Magic 8-ball, had to shake the answers out an opp
Catching bricks and throwing bows, I'm Enes Kanter on the block
I'm the wild west, I pull up to the tavеrn, set up shop
Finna climb on top on doggy bone, it's ladders on thе Glocks
Ride 'round with that cooler ice cream man
Plastic, check template, check my ID scan
Had to throw some wocky in my cup, the iced tea bland
Shout out to my jeweler, sit and watch my white tee dance
First day of Spring, that's 90 days until the Summer
Coming 'round the thumbers, you ain't got a thing that shit a bummer
Out the way, off the grid, like I'mma make 'em sit and wonder
No rap for 2 months, someone come and get the puncher
You cornballs can't catch up, someone get the mustard
Modern Warfare 2, I hop out and hit 'em with the Thumper
Don't call me by my government, keep heat like Jimmy Butler
I'm a hundred, I'm a hundred, just like 50 jumpers
I just broke my bank account, ain't even break a sweat
Loyalty earns royalty, like come on take the test
Buggin' like he fuckin' with the kid, he off an eighth of meth
Everything been going right, like everyday I pray, I'm blessed
