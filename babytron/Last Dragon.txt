[Intro: BabyTron]
"Catches bullets with his teeth? Nigga, please.""The secret awaits eyes unclouded by ambition.""What?""Those who are bound by desire see only that which can be held in their hands.""See, now it is mumbo jumbo like that, and skinny little lizards like you thinking they the Last Dragon that gives kung fu a bad name. Get up, Leroy"

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bitch, what? I'll turn into a grave digger
Thinking that you up, I'ma pull up, shoot a game winner
Double back twice in the store with the same hitter
How you want it, dawg, breath taker or the brain splitter?
Steak dinner now, it used to be leftovers
I ain't always ball, started off as a bench warmer
Star player now, that's probably why yo bitch bent over
Ball like AI, you're Tyronn, don't get stepped over
If her credit suck, that's a pointless-ass convo
Whole team scoring, passing plays out like Lonzo
Jam after jam, just hit Krogers with a combo
Good little drip, he might get splashed, wear a poncho
Steak bites and more, just asked the waiter for some A1
Thirty day grind, bitch, I made five on day one
Made three off one play, I kinda felt like Trae Young
.40 charged up, it'll zap you like a ray gun
Pockets speak facts or I could switch to the punchlines
It's 2:01 PM and I'm at Krogers, bitch, that's punch time
Ain't never been a shrimp but I'm at Ocean Prime for lunch time
I ain't gon' say I cashed the kicks, bitch, I punch mine
The way I up the chop, you would thought that I was scared to box
Gucci flops on, I paid two for a pair of socks
King of the scams, bitch, I'm feeling like De'Aaron Fox
Scat Pack roaring, I'ma call that bitch "Triceratops"
