[Intro]
Huh, hey, nyah, ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
Long live $cams, you know
Hell yeah, 5$TAR shit, man
(And the winner is PlaqueBoyMax)
[Chorus]
Me and Max'll both drop a triple-double, 'Bron and Luka
Why she talkin' 'bout she slim thick, when she got a F.U.P.A.?
We'll send 'em straight to God, like a hallelujah
I got a hitman in Flint, got a shot like Kuzma
And she gon' give me head and tail, fuck a coin flip
The way I'm playin' bitches, you'd think I had joysticks
I'm scrapin' everything on these, what your point is?
DSM full of great whites, y'all lil' boys shrimp
[Verse]
You need to worry about yourself, I done mastered me
You'd think Da Vinci did the fit, it's a masterpiece
They triеd to lock me out the game, but I'm thе master key
I might pull this bitch from full court, I done mastered threes
If he lays a finger on me, (pfft), catastrophe
Punch God, Jugg Messiah, I'm your majesty
We got two for twenty-fives, but it ain't Applebee'sTruck full of terabytes, call me Tronny Appleseed, huh
I told y'all boys, it's just the warm-up
It's almost twenty-one double, better score somethin'
I'll pull up in that Spectre thing, fuck that Porsche truck
I ain't even been here thirty minutes, this my fourth blunt
Huh, no fakin', no finish
It look like Jurassic Park, pull up, doors missin'
Yeah, this lil' bitch a ten, but she don't listen
I used to play the Sillybandz, now I'm froze wristin'
Five pockets full, it's twenty-thousand in the Chrome tee
I ain't surprised I'm feelin' odd, you know I poured three
BabyTron in the pink room, that's OP
C.O.D guns, if we get your drop, it's OV
They think they tied up the score, let's go to OT
We'll put a band on his head, LeBron in '03
Turkey bag terrorist, I'm smokin' out a whole P
Them YN days damn near over, I'm the OG
