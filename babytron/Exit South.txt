Lyrics from Snippet
[Verse]
When it comes to yo' team, you ain't valuable
Who the fuck gon' sip Wock'? Got a gallon-full
Boy, my range is maxed out, these intangables
It's a monster up inside me, tryna let him out
You a roleplayer, had to take the legend route
I-75 to the ten, had to exit South
He been too off the grid, I expect a drought
We ain't catch him out in traffic, we gon' check his house
Shot a video, a hunnid shits to edits out
Used to think you was in first, but you in second now
I been overgeekin' lately, need to settle down
Put the blick to his grin, he got a metal mouth
Once you in that deep end, it's hard to pedal out
Pray to God 'cause I can swear I sense the Devil 'round
Ain't no segregation, Unk' got white, and he sellin' brown
Wanna hang with the gang? You gotta tag a toe
Somethin' outta nothin', shit, that's what I'm braggin' fo'
Off a 3.5, taste like some casserole
I'mma spend it by myself, you gotta stack alone
No, I ain't got no heart, but the jacket Chrome
[?], I gotta pack a pole
Pop out with a stick, I see an opp, gon' whack-a-mole
Chillin in the booth, thinkin' of a caption blowed
Seein' out of town, Chris put me into mansion mode
Woulda thought I been wanted to rap, it was random...
