[Intro]
(
Helluva made this beat, baby
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I like Runtz, I like Wockhardt
I like hellcats, they can't keep up in the cop car
I like catching opps out let the Glock spark
High as hell, Larry 30 minutes this some 'za spark
Only three years in I'm on GOAT status
Kobe Bryant with this Backwood, it ain't no passing
Chrome Heart tee on my back I ain't [?]
Mortal Kombat with that yap, that bitch soul snatchin
I like hitting Hutch, finna go and get some new diamonds
B22s brand new bitch the shoes shinin
OT we in sports mode you see coupes flyin
Sauce green if it hit double back and 2 time it
Rapstar popping out with a dummy roll
White buffs 50 pointer shit I got a runny nose
Whip with the bee like I came out a honey comb
No matter what I bet that money flow
[Chorus: Dave Fio]
I like cars and I like clothes
I like bitches I like hoes
I like switches on my poles, cause im rich and I stay proud
[?] Balenciagas, pockets filled with [?] and hunnids
[?] or on that Prada let the money flow
