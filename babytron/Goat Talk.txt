Oh shit
ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
Zip yo lips when the GOAT speaking
Can't believe you cuffed a rat, she was so easy
Rather play a Fubu fit off some old Yeezys
Hit a bitch in LA, she thought that I was OhGeesy
Ran the check up all night like a lifetime
Fuck what ever time you on, bitch, it's my time
You against us? Huh, dummy, why try?
Block a ham then go MIA like I’m Whiteside
Everybody throat getting stepped on
Walk out the bank, Stan yelling, "Yes, Tron"
Straight-ass trip, fuck is a rest stop?
You verse' the Glock gon' result with a headshot
If yo grandma credit good, she's getting robbed
Bro walking around sticked up like a shish kebab
If he hit you, that's a first class trip to God
Stop asking me for the sauce, go and get a job
Ha-ha, they said they want the vintage Tron
Running missions with the gang, feel like Digimon
Money Crocs, hit the bank and just slip 'em on
Hardwood floors in the loft, what I'm dripping on
Got a hotspot for when the router offline
Don’t get blew like a whistle jumping off sides
Slide here? I done made a killing off slides
Looking like I came from art class in this Off-White
Lil' cold bitch and she bossy
Put four holes in his face like an Audi
Glock buff as hell even though that I'm scrawny
Lil' bitch choosing, said I put the "U" in "saucy"
They like, "Tron, why the fuck you always off beat?”
Never that, you just mad that I talk sweet
If it ain't the money, you done lost me
It's a cold world, I'ma make sure my dawgs eat
Bitch wanna lay up like I hoop still
This bitch finished, I mean too ill
Bro just collateralled the opps, that's two kills
First time I scammed is when I found out my true skill
You can catch me on a island eating grapes
Counting pape' in some BAPE with a smile on my face
SRT skrrting, burning miles out the tank
Next year, just watch, throwing diamonds in the chain
I could never show love off the last time
Fixed a bitch heart just so she could stab mines
Game face every time the hook pass by
No cap,
it's
a life sentence on this flash drive
If I stand still, the drip might drown me
OT balling coast to coast, Mike Conley
Back before Tron, I ain't have nobody
Hoes get down in my DMs, Yo Gotti
All that lil' energy? I'ma choke it out you
Bin Reaper, bitch, I'll knock the soul up out you
Ayy, labels, I need a big bonus out you
Payed bro the jackpot just to knock the tokens out you (Dumbass)
Jumped in and learned how to breath underwater
Doing fraud all day, I'm a punchaholic
Play with me? Boy, then you bound to touch a coffin
Code talking, asking doggy, "Do we got that what you call it?"
ShittyBoyz, bitch, I'm on the same side
Trend setter, I ain’t never have to wave ride
New method green, swear to God it’s game time
I'ma wipe his nose like it's runny but we ain't slime
Gold medalist, I refuse to get silver
I was born a loser but I turned into a winner
J. Ale's parking when I'm turning in for dinner
Heart cold as fuck now like it's turning into winter
