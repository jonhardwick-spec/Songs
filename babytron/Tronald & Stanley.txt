Bro gon' take the pop and Wockify it, all he sip is dirty
All these carats in my jewelry, ain't no way my vision blurry
Ram him with that 30 like I'm Todd, he just got hit with
girly
VVS's DD Osama-ing, bitch, they getting sturdy
Think he pressin' me and my posse? Gon' make him hit a gurney
He ain't got the Mamba Mentality, catch him switchin' jerseys
Soon as I wake up I'm encroaching opps, I be blitzing early
Bitch, I'm blowin' max volume, you rollin' up some mute
She ain't throwing head to the gang? I'm throwin' up this deuce
Mad scientist in the lab, pourin' up my juice
Thought he was Pit till he got bit, boy, yo bro is a pooch
I ain't even have to shoot his ass, I openhand smacked him
Blitzing with them blickies in that field, don't get yo mans tackled
Quagy-agy turned my Arctic Sun into a CranApple
In the deep, he hopped up out that water when we swam at him
Overdid the shrooms on Collins Ave, I'm in a crashed Phantom
Over slid the 201, got giffies like my ass Santa
Bought it as a white peach then turned it to a black Fanta
Blues on me like I'm Crippin', where the fuck my bandana?
You can't see me, John Cena, Fiji with the Wockiesha
All this fuckin' cheese and all this sauce, they think I got pizza
Why the fuck you actin' like you jamming with a locked Visa?
Pop him like a bottle of Ros√© and left his top leakin'
Fuck, he fast as hell, I'm sick he got away
Pendants clankin' on my neck, the bitch thought she heard pocket change
Benji, Benji, Benjies in my pocket, ain't no Honest Abes
Like a laundromat, I'm spinnin' blocks, boy, every opp a stain
Team full of demigods, we hit the court and dominate
Bet my neck be wetter than the water when I'm by the bay
Shooting tracers out, the only thing I think's annihilate
AMG look like a UFO, bitch, I might fly away
