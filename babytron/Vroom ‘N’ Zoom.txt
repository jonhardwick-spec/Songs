[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Awful lot of yeah, tell her nah if she ask for something
When it's up, I’m jumping, would've thought you seen a slasher dunking
Mr. Miyagi self scanning, bitch, I'm magic touching
Miris with the blue patches, bitch, the jeans match the hundreds
Trip mines, Molotovs, Ahki got some shit for opps
Six of Wocky, turn it dark skin when it hit the pop
Unky told me "It’s gon' lock everytime it hit the pop"
Tech season, lil' bitch, I'm playing with the Crocs
One of one, no duplication, charged up like a Super Saiyan
Tryna get for real money, scamming in my human races
If you ain't driving UPS, bitch, I ain't doing chasing
Doggy blew his savings, fuck a vest, we be shooting faces
Charged up like a Pikachu, it's buffs I'm peeking through
Rainstorm’ll cut the traction off then go swing the coupe
Talking about your coat a thousand dollars, I don’t see a Goose
Red two-fifty, but for me, I'm paying three a deuce
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Punching like Garcia, balling like LaMelo
Junk in her trunk, ass move like some Jell-o
They don’t want no smoke 'cause gang come blow 'em like a Rello
Always on the go, I do not see the color yellow
Worry 'bout the green, I get my cabbage and I mind my biz
I don’t wrestle, boy, I look like the (?)
Fuck, now the chopstick kicking like it's Real Madrid
Got her friend tryna tag her on, she told her how I live
ShittyBoyz shit before Amiri flew on Robin jeans
Thumbing through the money when I'm sad, it boost my self esteem
Can't believe I wake up in a world that I used to dream
I just touched down in Arizona, feel like A.J Green
Treat me like the one and give me neck I just might double back
You be living off on the master splinters, I cannot cuff a rat
ShittyBoyz the king of the samples, that's a fucking fact
BBCT Hutch piece and the Crocs is black
