[Intro: BabyTron]
Rookie of the year, call me "Luka Trončić"
You could be Charmin and you still wouldn't be on shit (
Reuel, stop playing with these niggas
)
Ayy
Pour the six in my
Pour the six in my
I pour the six in my
ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Pour the six in my Calypso
Life changed when I learned
about
that crypto
Semi with the sight, boy, don't get quickscoped
Sauce God, come with a band, you can get coached
A hundred times ten, boy, I was made to rap
Indiana Jones, every mission I'ma make it back
Road runner, dukes asked where my patience at
Feel like Rocket Power, me and gang gang skating Scats
This AR? Ha-ha, has JJ Redick range
Fuck the forecast, hit the strip and let it rain
This bitch a geek, she just gave my ass impressive brain
Jumped off the porch but went back 'cause FedEx came
She said, "Tron, you look like Ricky Rubio"
Watch yo mouth, bitch, you know it's Giffy Rubio
Fraud fiend, brought the reader to the studio
Cards work magic like the Visa came from Yu-Gi-Oh!
