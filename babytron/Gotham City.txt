[Intro]
(Fuck the fire, we got grease)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
She got D'usse in her solo? Finna double team her
Hothead with blicky on him? Bro a trouble seeker
Bitch a dummy, she don't think I'm finna fucking leave her
(Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby)
Palm Angels joggy but Dior did my running sneakers
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
SUV with the bike rack, blending in with traffic
Know the Men in Black, for some guala, send 'em in with gadgets
Tripping over hoes? Can't relate, I'm stepping with some balance
You hating out a hut, bitch, I'm riding, heading to my mansion
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Brodie took a Perc' and washed it down with somе Wockiesha
You ain't gotta tell me you ain't brokе 'cause I'm not either
I can't fuck with you 'cause you with them, they some cock eaters
Got her out her clothes then broke her back in a wifebeater
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Poles, hoes, and blue strips, the whip like Erotic City
Needa take the chop up to Pink, this bitch got some titties
Bro equipped the mask, robbing shit like it's Gotham City
Seven hunnid horses, stabbed the gas, I might pop a wheelie
