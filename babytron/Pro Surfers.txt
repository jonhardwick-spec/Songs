[Intro: Rio Da Yung OG]
(Helluva made this beat, baby)
(
Smoke on the beat
)
Yeah
What up, BabyTron?
It's Rio, nigga, Da Yung OG
'Boyz in this bitch, nigga
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
[Verse 1: Rio Da Yung OG]
Dog shit on me right now, came from servin' grams
You got dog shit on you right now, but gotta turn it in
Told Tron, "Teach me how to swipe, I can’t work a BIN"
But, shit, if she got the money, I’ll serve my grams
Ayy, it’s a cold world
I don’t want no head from her, she got a cold sore
Use my last bitch name and walk into the phone storeI really made a twenty off my ex, but not my old girl
I’m the truth, throwin' blue hunnids on old girl
But I got a bitch, so when we text, we use code words
I ain’t putting in on your drink, I got my own four
It’s too much money out here, what you at home for?
Shot a black nigga thirty times with a chrome .40
Would tell you how I got away, but that’s a long story
If a nigga say he robbed me, that’s the wrong story
Man, ask that nigga why his mothafuckin' bones hurting
Spinned the bitch and seen her out and told her my phone ain’t working
You ain’t getting off on me, bro, I’m the wrong person
Drop my pill in drink and reel it in, call it goin' Perking
Niggas riding waves 'round this bitch like a pro surfer
