[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Ayy,
it ain't Fortnite but my circle getting small
Got Visas, had to trade in the basketball
Hoes choosing, guess I'm the man after all
Iced up, sticked up, niggas play for Montreal
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Construction crew, how my niggas knock down the mall
Swipe this, punch that, I done broke a lot of laws
Told coach throw me in the game, it's my time to ball
Broke, bummy, and hating, that's a lot of y'all
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Pockets fat, bitch, high cholesterol
Bro'll put one in yo ass if you get involved
Pussy wet, jump in, that's a cannonball
Ninety-nine, nigga, that's my pieces overall
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Still sleeping on the gang? They off TYLENOL
But when we blow, they gon' be the first on our balls
Bro keep two straps on him like he wearing overalls
Been balling on these niggas 'fore I even touched a ball
