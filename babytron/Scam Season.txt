[Verse 1]
Your plug is a ham, get your source right
Road running with them cards, this my fourth night
Bro in her walls, beat 'em down like it's Fortnite
Smacked off a 'Wood, eating [?] this my fourth slice
If swiping was a sport, I'd go D1
Bro'll blow your ass like Steph blew that 3-1
Yeah, you talking bands but I ain't seen one
Take them dirt balls off your feet, these the clean ones
In a month or two you see me up a hundred blues
I jugged about a hundred hams out a hundred shoes
I know about a hundred goons with a hundred tools
If they pull up, they gon' probably leave a hundred tombs
The only thing on my head is
Just Don
Donny Bands, that's my dawg, don't get thrust on
Flex in the Big B's, I used to have the Chucks on
Ham asked where her shoes at, get the fuck on
[Chorus]
Thrusted up on that bitch for no damn reason
Busting juggs if I gotta play, my mans eating
All year nonstop, this that scam season
On the road, turn around, this that scam season
Thrusted up on that bitch for no damn reason
Busting juggs if I gotta play, my mans eating
All year nonstop, this that scam season
On the road, turn around, this that scam season
