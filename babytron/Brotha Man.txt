ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
Turn the strip into a pool party
Call Hutch, Hutch fuck around blew on my new Cartis
School? Man, fuck it, I was too tardy
I'ma shoot that bitch, had to tell coach to two guard me
She ain't gon' answer, my dick in her throat
Bitch, I'm big scamming, brought the chips in the store
Fooling in the store, I'm a wizard, bitch, I'm the GOAT
Oh, that lil' bitch? I'ma spin her unless I'm getting throat
Am I up? Bitch, does it blizzard if it snows?
This the yacht life, blowing 'Woods, shitting on a boat
Wockhardt, mm-hmm, we sip it when we toast
Unc' like The Rock with the dog, hit it with a boat
Unky off two cans of beer like he Stone Cold
Put my bicep in the air, bitch, I showboat
Snapchat filter while she suck it, it's a slow-mo
Talking 'bout punching something? Bitch, you a slow ho
Yeah, like, please
Feel like Spike Lee, courtside, white tee
I'm a asshole, why the fuck she like me?
Real life dickhead, that's why they wanna fight me
Brother man, I'll beat the shit out you then spit on you
Brother man, I'll up the, yeah, and then shit on you
Don't get a gravestone, yeah, we'll piss on you
Ju freaky-ass, if you tweak, he'll lick on you
Her freaky-ass? Oh yeah, she'll lick on me
She talk 'bout you had me running when you put the tip on it
Scat Pack in the Hellcat, I had to switch on it
Hit Chase for the blue cheese then finger lick on 'em
I'm eating great, bitch
Smoke Cake Mix, hell nah, I don't cake, bitch
Jack day shit for real life down the way, bitch
I'ma turn this lil' bitch cuckoo when she taste this
I ain't got no noodles, I'm a killer, I erase shit
If you bump into me, I'm with 'rillas, on some ape shit
Woke up wooping, I need Skilla on my tape, bitch
You got a strong-ass chest but I'ma hit you in yo face, bitch
God walked up to me in my dream and said I'm chose, for real
Clay got a problem with the Glock, I just hope he chill
Killers on the West, they be in Brightmoor, for real
Got a playbook, you can come get coached, for real
Skinny jeans full of bands, I done got a leg bruise
Yo baby mama sick like, damn, she brought the head through
Took her upstairs, goddamn, now the bed through
Took him upstairs, Heaven is his new bedroom
Cheated on my bitch, she talking 'bout I smell you
P90 with no cooling, I done brought hell through
Feel like Gregg Pop with my gang, I just yell shoot
Clay and Dee, they let me find out 'bout L2
You better not let me hold square
Dior flops, I did not wax my toe hair
Hopping on this wave? Boy, you better bring a boat there
Jumped in the deep, deep, deep, no air
