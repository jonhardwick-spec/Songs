Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat

[Verse 1: $weet-T]
Your bitch just hit my phone like, "$weet, let me get to toppin' ya"
The raw locked my fiend's jaw, can cop you some tilapia
My gang hang blicky off the hip, blow stogies like the mafia
Gustavo in the whip, it got shipped all the way from Bosnia
Couldn't compete with $weet, it ain't a soul that said, "I'm stoppin' ya"
But don't act all surprised when Dutchmaster gets to poppin' ya
I ain't no cameraman, but out the flick is where I'm croppin' ya
Your bitch nodded in agreement when I said, "The gang is swappin' ya"
What you know about the mafia? What you know about the gang?
Boy, what you know about the mob? I'm already knowin' you can't hang
You just pull up, park, and bark, we slide by and let it bang
I'm in the field with rats and snakes, careful for thе claws and fangs
Bro put some flavor in his cup, but he ain't sippin' on no Tang
All the placеs where I hang gave my slang a little twang
I like big guns, but I'll slide down and swing that little thing
I like big buns, but your girl slid through and swang that little thing
Man, tell your bitch to stay away, I dog these hoes like it's a sport
Yeah, I'm hard like some courts, all my opps can eat my shorts
Your people pour up with a pint, my people pour pints and quarts
Keep on actin' like Big Meech, we'll leave your ass stank on Fort
You can't sneak up on Big $weet, you'd think my ears are big as Dumbo's
This bitch got some itty-bitties, but that booty super jumbo
The zotti got me out my body, you be blowin' down that bunko
Before you ever talk that junk, just know we move like the Colombos
Tryna fuck with Big $weet, buddy boy, go pound the sand
I take your bitch to pound town after I hound down you and your mans
Nah, I'm playin', fight this 40, I don't really got no hands
I made your bitch suck my glans, then got right back to the plans
