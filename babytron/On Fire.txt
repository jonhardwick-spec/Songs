[Intro: StanWill]
(
Jose the Plug

I, I, I, I, I
[Verse 1: StanWill]
I could never play the middle (Nah)
I got more stripes than a referee, we know you ain't official
Think you hackin', we get active, boy, you know we play the whistles (Brrt)
This shit every day, you know I played the pistol (Yeah)
All my hoes Barbie (Yeah), all your hoes rats (Yeah)
All my hoes snatched (Yeah), you get all your hoes snatched (Yeah)
I'm with the militia, look like Truth how we got poles, jack (Brrt)
Paparazzi, Glocky got the flash, you better pose, jack (Posе)
Bitch, I get to runnin', runnin' all like a triathlon
[Verse 2: TrDee]
You ain't know that we bе sendin' bullets out with MegaTron
Duck your taco, we gon' hit you in it or gon' knock it off
Must ain't know that we be swingin' sticks like we be playin' golf
I'm on fire, shit, I feel like Weezy F Baby
I peep niggas stealin' style, y'all gon' have to pay me
I heard you ain't ball long like Tracy McGrady
AR sittin' in the crib like we in the Navy
I be workin' like I'm broke because I'm scared of that
If my mama knew ho much this cost, she'd have a heart attack
