[Verse 1: BandGang Biggs]
Why the fuck these niggas acting rich, but they ain't copping shit?
My niggas get to bussing at your top, and they is not gon' miss
Oops, I think I'm tripping, spilling lean on my Prada kicks
She bring me back the [?], so I put Gucci on my bottom bitch
Field trip, might blow six, in every picture, I throw six
Smoke opps and smoke zips, if I want him, bro, go get him
Acting homophobic, I don't fuck around with ho niggas
45 shoot like Jordan, if you opping, I feel no tension
Room full of killers, big broom leave you missing
I ain't even gotta move, Big Boom come and get you
Pool full of liquor, your bitch swimming in my seaman
She bent over on her hands and toes, like she playing defence
Adding up the [?], then subtracting from my friends and foes
Hit the club with gang, and we act out like we ain't got self control
Come fuck with a boss, I know your bitch get tired of hearing no's
How much money I make off scamming hams? World may never know
How much money I make off scamming hams? World may never know
How much money I make off scamming hams? World may never know
Hit the club with gang, we act out like we ain't got self control
How much money I make off scamming hams? World may never know
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Huch got me freezing like an Eskimo
Told the source before I buy it, gotta test the load
We gon' sweep him, [?] I bet we send him home
Unc got keys from Mexico, [?] Texico
Dawgy living wrong, tryna impress the hoes
Couldn't crack it from the start, they tryna guess the code
You can't show your paperwork, I don't respect you, bro
Off Whizzy kicks, I fucked around and Ex'ed the toes
I've been high for days
Overdid the shrooms, while I was geeking off a pint of quay
On my Super Sayen shit, but I ain't reach my final stage
Whip a U.F.O., might fuck around and go to hyperspace
Ribs scam, I'm finna hit the giffy ray
When you really in that war zone, it ain't no mini map
Took a 20 there, I brought a 60 back
Took a 50 there, and I made 6 digits
Us vs them, shit, that's a big difference
Cutty linebacker in the field, he hit sticking
Drop top, arm out, I let my wrist glissin
Brodie moving like the walking dead, 'cause he was [?]
