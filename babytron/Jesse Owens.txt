Bitch
Like that
(I wonder what the weather’s like today)
Ha-ha, ayy
[Verse]
Keep it real with me 'cause I'ma always keep it real with you
Sauce God, can't spill a drop, they tryna steal my juice
Girly hit me with the, "Where you at?", shit, I'm finna scoop
Pretty bitch, look her in her eyes like, "Do you feel it too?"
Heard girly block shots, shit, I'm finna shoot
Balenciaga shopping, told the clerk I need the biggest shoes
Riding 'round with ladders like we finna fix a roof
Call of Duty shit, hunnid weapons hidden in thе coupe
Good work ethic, no more strеssing
Road running, only got four more exits
Remember being on the dice, could roll no sevens
Fuck around and hit the shot with four more seconds
Really put my all into this shit, don't understand the hate
But all them hating comments, type of shit to make me activate
Before the rap, had pape, name been had some weight
Bitch left me back then, now she got the saddest face
Bitch left me back then, she know she made a dumb decision
He ain't playin on my team if he ain't got no hustle in him
Pull up scoring so easy, man, this shit another scrimmage
Eyes on the money, right now I got tunnel vision
Six figure man but just know that I'm coming millions
2017, StanWill, I was punching with him
Call the opps like, "These yo hoes? Oh, come and get 'em"He was dick sucking back then, I ain't fuckin with him
I can run on any beat like I'm Jesse Owens
Really tryna run it up so right now I got heavy focus
Four bullets in that clip? Boy, you petty toting
Tryna slide down here with that? Boy, I bet we blow him
Huh, yeah, no rap capping
Off-White this and that but, nah, I ain't a crack addict
Star player, every night catch me stat packing
201s at the self-scan, I'm doing jam magic
Scuff the sneaks once then they in the trash
Ain't no late night hiding, boy, we coming with the flash
Said he got an eighth shorted? My bad, the digi lagged
Three thousand dollar something fit, with my drippy-ass
Outta town 'cause it's less commotion
Shoutout Hutch, my neck an ocean
If it's on the floor, I'm stepping on it
Told the Lean Man come through with some extra potion
