Bitch, I'm so high, I ain't gon' lie
Bitch, I'm so fly, I ain't gon' lie
Ayy, huh, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
ShittyBoyz (Ayy)
[Verse]
If I toss it, will you run it?
If I throw it, will you catch it?
You be steady dick sucking, I'm just steady counting blessings
I just sent her in the bank, it's gon' take a couple seconds
I'ma give his ass some wings, I'ma send him up to Heaven
Like, ayy
If you won't suck it then yo will friend will
All that crunchy talk, fuck around and get yo friend killed
Her head weak as hell, I wish she had her friend still
In the morning catching jacks, this a steak and egg meal
I know you high, bitch, I put a Perky in yo 'Wood
Took her last five hunnid, know she's hurting from that jugg
Middle man, middle man, boy, you perping like the plug
You can't see the blicky poking 'cause the Purple's full of dubs
Bitch asked me do I give a fuck
Yo mans got popped, you look silly tryna pick him up
Hit him in his, with the, watch him stiffen up
Can't do the texts or the calls, I'm tryna get a nut
Wocky got me in my zone, lil' bitch, come and do yo thang
Taliban with me, turn yo brim into a shooting range
.556, you acting buff? I send one through yo friends
Huh, yeah, made twenty in two more days
Flying out to Tokyo, I'm finna catch 'bout two more planes
If I throw that one signal up, you gon' lose yo face
Running to the pape'? Lil' bitch, you gon' lose that race
They gon' have the sad face when I'm coming new-ass Wraith
Let me tell you something
You be walking 'round this bitch loose, no, I can't sell you nothing
Legs both did that little jump, she can tell I'm nutting
Scam after scam after scam after scam got my celly jumping
'016, first whip, bitch, I been did it
I was fifteen busting scams, bitch, I been shitting
I was seventeen with 'bout thirty, my BINs been hitting
I been fucking dimes since forever, yo bitch been finished
Yeah, that bitch big finished
Slingshot with the jerk on it, had to shift with it
Clutching on the Glock, look at you like don't get lift with it
Hellcat with the muscle in it, I feel like him in it
Off-White Virgil 1's, they finna hit the gym in it
Better ask around, yeah, bitch, lil' Jimmy been with it
He gon' do that tough tone shit until this bitch hit him
In a pothole, I fucked around and had to switch rims
Stop looking at my 'Wood, boy, this bitch a facer
Turtle Pie or the Runtz, we got different flavors
Yeah, I got bangs but this chop, it'll get them tapers
Aw shit, man
Yeah, I can't forget the lasers
Purple and the yellow Palm Angels, I play with the Lakers
Tuck yo chain, tuck yo bitch, boy, I came in with the taker
Talking 'bout some eight hunnid dollars, boy, this bitch ungrateful
Throw her out the whip
Blow him in his shit, guarantee that I won't throw a fist
Bitch, you smoking dick if you say I'm not a GOAT with it
Both hands with the, use yo throat with it
Taught her well, I'm a coach with it
What can I say? Brother man, I got the golden stick
These some bullets you cannot catch if I throw this bitch
Looked him in his eyes and looked down, see the ho in him
And the scuffs on his shoes, what the fuck?
I'm just counting through some blues, ayy
This bitch won't even light, ShittyBoyz
