[Intro: TrDee]
(
Ayo, Mark A
)
Bitch
Ho
Yeah
Like, damn, let me catch the fucking beat first
[Verse 1: TrDee]
I'm not no Crip but you can always catch me with some blues
You cannot play me, you gon' have to wait till April Fools
Buddy want some clout? Then we gon' have to put him on the news
Got a couple hoes, I used to have holes in my shoes
Mask on in the bank, wanna help me scam safe
Let me hit it, I'ma try to beat it till the bed break
Stay away from niggas, they ain't nothing but some dead weight
Won't cuff a bitch, they ain't shit but a headache
King suite, she gon' want to fuck me when she see the view
Why you being stingy? Tell yo friend that she can get it too
Why you cop a vest? You better pray yo head is bulletproof
Let us get it social then this bank account is going poof
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Bro off two T's, six whippets, and a eighth of Runtz
They ain't think that I would touchdown like I faked the punt
Finna do the shrimp and grits now but it's steak for lunch
Finna do the, man, fuck that
Bet not start that Camaro, this a Karma Revero
Headshot, bullseye, I hit my mark with my arrow
7.62s, .223s sparking out the barrel
Gold chain, fuck a king, with these cards I'm a pharaoh
Four of Wock' slow the world down, I'm taking turtle sips
Every obstacle I ever faced, bitch, I hurdled it
Catch a ham out, flip the switch, get a burger flipped
You can't tell me shit about the trenches, this the Murder Mitt
