[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'm her MCM, MCM belt on like Mermaid Man (Mermaid Man)
Bitch a city girl, she wanna fuck 'cause she heard I scam
Tryna fuck with me, boy, that's like tryna surf on sand
BIN so fire, punched up and I burned my hand
[Verse 2: Since99]
He can't pay his rent, so he 'bout to go scam his fans
How the hell it's 2021, you still taking Xans?
I'ma spread the pape' with my thumbs and watch it expand (Thumbs)
Hoes watching me just like a TV, I'm on demand (Watching)
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
I can run the play or catch the bag, I'm a slotback
Never been racist, ash white and my pop black
Snatch a bitch heart out her chest like Mortal Kombat
(Get over here)
Woke up late on the jacks, where the fuck my Crocs at? (Where they at?)
[Verse 4: Since99]
Hit the vibe in the BNB, where my socks at? (Wow)
How you gon' pour a pint of Tris, but the pop flat? (Yeah)
Pulling up unannounced to your crib in all black (Damn)
Limoncello in the blunt, rolling up that top pack (Phew, phew, phew)
