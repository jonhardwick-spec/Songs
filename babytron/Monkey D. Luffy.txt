[Intro]
Paid the whole bill, your bitch said you the split it type
(
Jay, this shit too crazy
)
Poor-ass lil' boy
Yeah
Huh
[Verse 1]
Paid the whole bill, your bitch said you the split it type
Demons all around me, prayer'd up, I ain't living right
Unky got some bully off the leash, had to hit it twice
Darrelle Revis, pick you off you try and pick a fight
Nice guy, you really can't tell cause my mug mean
Chain water, diamonds dancing, gleaming off the sun beams
Talking 'bout you sipping
mud
, where, dude? Your cup clean
I been getting money since before my phone was touchscreen
Star player, boy, I hope the haters got the front seat
Monkey D. Luffy, I'm in my duffy off of One Piece
Shout out to that BIN, fire six, all my dumps heat
Heard doggy undercover, 21 Jump Street
Flying 'round with sticks, like a witch, shit get wicked quick
Get the head, then like a chip, bitch, I'm finna dip
Twenty-eight Amiris, tryna get the dog shit to fit
Laying in the ditch, face split, that's what snitches get
Double cup, deuce of Wocky, nah, this ain't Biggby's coffee
Unky got a kennel in the kitchen, it's 'bout fifty doggies
Touchdown, call ocky, tell him get them giffies off me
Nike Tech vet, I done ran through like sixty joggers
Southpaw, hit the self scan, jabbing with my right
Sending bitches in, like, "You gotta jam it, then you swipe"
Worth a mill' ticket when I'm standin' by a mic
Why you talkin' 'bout some money? Never had it in your life
