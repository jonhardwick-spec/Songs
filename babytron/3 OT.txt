[Intro]
Round of applause, I let that Drac'—
(
Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby
)
Round of applause, I let that Drac'—
[Verse]
I hope you got your chin strap and mouthguard, the fields physical
In a new crib with the big yard, I used to wake up and feel miserable
If the money visible, go get it, that's the principle
Time to do him pitiful, his health bar on critical
World's dumbest criminal, like, boy, you just an imbecile
I ain't lie once, guess the songs non-fictional
Bitch broke past repair, she is not fixable
Shooter got a cannon but ain't never shot visuals
Throwin' powder up, cuddy doin' bronze ritual
Only got some neck to offer, this lil' thot's typical
Huh, alright, let's turn it up a notch
Pirellis came with stripper tendencies, they burnin' up the block
It's the main tool in my kit, can't work without my Glock
Made my own wave, you can catch me surfin' to the top
Should've grabbed it while you had the money, verses cost a lot
Cuddy never flipped his tassel, he was learnin' on the block
Think I'm finna make it, cops still searchin' for the spot
Ridin' with them terrorists, they play the turbans off the chops
Over seven hundred horses skrrtin' off the lot
She deserves it, bought my bitch a Birkin while we shopped
I ain't never been scared, I'm only nervous 'round the cops
In love with it, before I had it, I was flirtin' with the guap
Run off with the bag, gon' shoot his sneaks and turn 'em into socks
In the Wraithy, noided, peekin' through the curtains with my Glock
Ain't nothin' worser than my opps
Twenty years from now, imagine unky servin' them some rocks
Let a hundred off, you ever felt a furnace when it's hot?
R.I.P my baby Mauri, we was right off Curtis, tryna plot
Flyin' to the drank man to purchase me some Wock'
Then I'm flyin' to the Marathon to purchase me a pop
Dracs goin'— they'd think Certi hit they block
We ain't harmin' animals, but it's a birdie in the pot
It's 7:11 on the dot, she slurp me in the top
Shit, fuck, damn, this bitch slurp me out my Crocs
Case dismissed, my attorney off the clock
Ain't no pen, ain't no pad, this for surely off the top
Played it like I liked her 'til I got lil' girly out they drop
Hundred bags foreign, but it ain't no turkeys at the spot
Christmas time, I was empty-handed
Now I'm past out GIFs with my presi' dancin'
Bro ain't even out of town, can catch at the telly trappin'
You ain't gotta tell me what you doin', I get helly active
Shit, I'm tryna make it last forever
You a band away, this time to get your stash together
You a bad friend, it's time to get your mans together
Reachin' in my bag, I'ma tie your hands together, then cut 'em off
You the type to hate making money, but love to talk
Still ain't go and drop a whip, like, you must love to walk
Put up the down payment, pussy, I can't front the sauce
If they see me do it, catch 'em at a bridge jumpin' off
He just trapped in his mind, ain't really stuck at all
Put in triple overtime, this really wasn't luck at all
Throw it up and twist my fingers, then I pray the bucket fall
Stop thinkin' that I'm nice 'cause I don't fuck with y'all
And probably never will
