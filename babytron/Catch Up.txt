[Intro]
(
It's Lando, your bitch know, don't let your bitch go, nigga
)
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia, THHL, you know?
Yeah, hey
[Verse]
If it ain't the Marni, it's Mahimas
Lurkin' out with monsters, slidin' 'round with behemoths
Ridin' 'round in a Demon
Smellin' like some 'za, you'd think I'm walkin' with some pounds out of Neimans
Bitch talk a lil' too much, but that mouth undefeated
I had thought I lost my mind 'til I found and retrieved it
If he play with us on Monday, won't get found 'til the weekend
Go and grab a fuckin' snorkel 'fore you drown in the deep end
Quarter-ticket grind, I can make a hundred thou' by week ten
Come and get your yerkies from the spot, we sellin' cheap tens
Me and Trapper in Wisconsin, fuck
Me and Trapper in Wisconsin, packin' like some cheese heads
Heard you pay for pussy, what you know 'bout free head?
I'm a lean head, not no hit drank, this clean red
Cuddy mixin' fetty with the—, it look like cheese eggs
You ain't makin' cheese? You might as well be dead
Dog broke as hell too, y'all might as well be friends
It's a dirty game, fuck around and leave my—, ayy, ayy
It's a dirty game, fuck around and leave my cleats red
Ayy, shit, I heard you got a job, what the fuck you know 'bout free bread?
If you Deebo, I must be Craig
All these hoes, we need six bottles, three beds
Wiped his nose, you'd think the ten-milli' a Kleenex
Kapitals a twenty-nine, the shirt a small, the load a 3X
The Shelby truck roarin', would've thought I cloned a T-Rex
I was loadin' rifles up while you was tryna fold your DS
Tuh, I got some pros you ain't seen yet
Tuh, tuh, tuh, I'm with a ho you ain't seen yet
The weight on my back, shit, it's time to let the team rest
Spillin' mud on show money, but it's still a clean check
Break the Ring camera 'fore we catch the hat
We gotta bring the Ring camera 'fore we catch the jacks
Pause, but I'ma catch the sack
Slidin' down, you lucky if the only thing you catch some flats, buster
I got two words, catch up, mustard
They've been down the last three, the next one's they catch-up summer
Christian Loubies with the spikes, I'm walkin' 'round in ketchup runners
In the chase with them boys yellin' out, "Catch up, fuckers"
