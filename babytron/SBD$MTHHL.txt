[Verse 1: ScrumbleMan]
On the road all year, my only fear is catchin' flats
Unc' be trippin', shiftin' gears, spinnin' blocks and catchin' hats
Message your bitch, "I got racks," that's why she always textin' back
Why you gettin' bullied by your opps? Bitch, you ain't gettin' back, look
I got drip wetter than a leaking faucet
You got reggie 'bows, that is not it, you need to toss 'em
[Verse 2: MJPAID]
Like a Crip, I got blues in my jeans when I'm walkin'
Dog ain't really makin' money, I can tell you just talkin'
Nigga say he want me on his tape, it's gon' cost him
I done took niggas' bitches, I done took hella losses
Fuck it, call me Steve, I was cold out in Austin
R.I.P. Nip, had sixty blues on me right on Slauson
[Verse 3: Fordio]
Had to take a brеak from the in-and-out at Target
I don't really strеss, bootin' up as I'm noddin'
And I'm tryna make it farther but juggin' in the process
Runnin' in stores, gotta be cautious, they'd rather see me locked, damn
Might let some thoughts spill, you know I like my drank sealed
If it don't profit, I'm sorry, I can't comprehend
