[Intro]
(
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
[Verse 1: BandGang Biggs]
We in this bitch, won’t pop another Addy
Tell yo bitch don't come tripping, save them problems for yo daddy
I like 'em pretty with a fatty, do it nasty
Catch yo mans out in traffic, hit the switch and do him nasty
We got like ten GOATs in one stu’
Bitch, I done told you
Up the chop, hit the switch and flip like a Roku
Say you know the gang? Lil' bitch, we don't know you
Bitch lying on the dick, said she got hit but got no proof
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Every punch I grab, it's on fire, I'm like Goku
Stop acting high, that's a pressed pill I sold you
Wouldn't throw a jab or a hook, we gon' blow you
Beam, flash, fuck around and add the scope too
Been getting money, how I’m ’posed to
In my DMs talking 'bout we cousins, I don’t know you
Sleve Nash, I can score the shit or I could throw'oops
Red Adidas soccеr pants on but the roll blue
[Verse 3: BandGang Biggs]
Any weathеr, I might pull up on you in a snowsuit
.9 on me when I'm in the city, this my go to
I ain't got no friends, Instagram got me like, close who?
Only the family, them my niggas, we’ll blow you
Walk 'em down like I'm NLE but I'm BMBG
Mama said, "Son, I wanna see you on TV"
But I'm too caught up in the hype, can't get up out the streets
I'm out here thugging everyday, seven days a week
