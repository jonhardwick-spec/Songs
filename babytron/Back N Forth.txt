[Verse 1: Kasher Quon]
I told Tron step in the booth, we going back in forth
You say that you the plug? You is not the source
Just a fucking dork
I ain't had my gun, I had to stab him with a fork
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Only liked a pic just to fuck, she a whore for sure
Rich got the purple, Chris Webber, catch him pouring four
If Kasher got beef with doggy bone, we going door to door
But right now we road running, 201s, we store to store
[Verse 3: Kasher Quon]
I'm counting up 100K right now, better close the door
If she ain't fuck me, she fuck one of my bros for sure
That bitch get around
Put a red beam on that nigga's nose since he a clown
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Yo brother six feet in the earth, you can't dig him out
Luka Trončić, star player shit, watch me dribble 'round
No cap, it's a triple-double if I'm in yo town
Standing up? Got a baby Drakey that'll sit 'em down
