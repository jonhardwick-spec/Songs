[Intro]
Nyah (Bitch)
[Verse]
Your gang a circus full of clowns
Pulled up in some Diesel jeans for her to pull 'em down
You would think that cuddy chest pressin' how he pushin' poundsYou get pushed around
You be lookin' up to motherfuckers, I be lookin' down
Fully switch'll turn his
hoopty
to a unicycle
Huntin' for an opp, no, not a deer I ever shoot a rifle
If I'm ever number-one contender, they gon' lose the title
Feelin' like I'm T Bone, I'll ride rockets for new arrivals
Catch that pussy, make him bleed like he was goin' through a cycle
Golden rope, it's wrapped around my neck, you'd think I'm suicidal
Any time my brother ran a route, you know I threw a spiral
As many times I spinned your lil' ho, you'd think your boo a vinyl
You could never hit the stage, the crowd'd throw tomatoes at you
When it's time to go and slide, I might just throw the Draco at you
I hope you ready, ain't no bitchin'
I hope you should keep your album in the vault off how the snippets sound
You would think we fillin' up balloons with all these whippits 'round
Walk him down, then run away, then you can catch me skippin' towns
Off an Addy, you would think I popped a NoDoz
Dressin' like a samurai, I popped out Yohji Yamamotos
Golden Presi' chocolate face, you'd probably think the watch a Rolo
Live the fast live, and with this double cup, I'm drivin' slo-mo
He got biscuits on his feet, in other words, he's rockin' no-nos
Custo bought a bird that couldn't even fly, he copped a dodo, bitch
The chains hit different, you would think I'm FYB
If I stacked the mula, it'll fit right in in NYC
Problems in my life a lil' more serious than XYZ
Ho brain extravagant, she should've went to MIT
I got pull in Pontiac, you would think I'm DDG
Me and brodie ridin' 'round with twin Glocks, DCG
Give him angel wings, turn him to dust, the bullets PCP
What he's wearin' ancient, think his 'fit was made in BCE
Y'all was playin' Manhunt, we was hittin' cribs
Y'all was grindin' My Park while me and gang was hittin' licks
Y'all don't got a thing to eat, we've been diggin' in
Real life GTA, but shit, the only mission's win
Make your bitch swallow my sword
If you lookin' for the plug, you better just follow the cords
Life gets hard, just hold on tight, somethin' like a trapeze
Gang deep as hell on bullshit, somethin' like a stampede
