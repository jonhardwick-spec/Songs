[Intro]
(
Hokatiwi
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Told the clerk, "Blue strip me out, I'm a Crip tonight"
Pull up on a opp around ten, brodie, dim your lights
We gon' let it rip, ain't no need for really having fights
SB X Hokatiwi, real scary sight
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Bro threw his wrist up, singing 41 like YT
Goose made in Canada, my joggy, it say "Y-3"
Glock on me, made him step back like he Kyrie
She like, "Boy, you dripping all Gucci?", bitch, I might be
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Supreme balaclava, Goose coat, I'm a hypebeast
Handmade jeans, one of one, ain't have to swipe these
Bitch ain't never seen no drink before like, "Why the Sprite pink?"
Fireman with the punch work, every site green
[Verse 4: TrDee]
Ask the bitch who do she love, think I'm YG
Purple jeans, MCM belt with a white tee
You could search the earth, it is not nobody like me
When they see you shining, they gon' act like they cannot see
