[Verse 1: DaeMoney]
Twelve hundred for the pants, hangin' crazy off the Lanvins (Yeah)
Clean cream soda, 'bout to paint it like a canvas
We the youngest niggas doin' it, you can tell this ain't average (I promise)
I swear I still be laughin', I get paid off of rappin' (Wow)
I ain't see a soul when I was out this bitch trappin' (I didn't)
Blowin' all my money, I ain't know how to stack it (Damn)
All them trips to Wisconsin turned a nigga to a packer
Off the Xannies, I done woke up with a Hollywood actor (Oh, my God)
Got a dub in all fifties, I know that it look pretty (Yeah)
World tour ShittyBoyz, we took over the city (The mob)
She got my name tatted, I done took over her titty
We got the trap banging like it's Marco shit and Bittie
I been high all day, shit, I started sipping early (Fuck)
Marni zipped up, my niece say I look furry (Let's get it)
If Slae around your bitch, then I think you need to worry (Yeah)
You touch any nigga with me, then I swear to God we purgin' (Brrat)
