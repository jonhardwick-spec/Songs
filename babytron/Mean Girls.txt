[Intro: Shaudy Kash]
Yop, ayy
[Verse 1: Shaudy Kash]
I'm the shit to these bitches, somethin' they ain't seen before
I got a vibe they can only get with me, they need more
Plus I been past these lame niggas, I ain't keepin' score
Been hittin' bad hoes that ain't shit, they like Regina George
Told lil' baby be herself and she gon' be somethin'
Let me guess, on Wednesday, you wear pink, huh?
You should hold your horses, I don't wanna get you T'd up
'Cause any bitch that can't be herself, I end up leavin' her
Get it right, baby, I ain't said nothin' but a word
My type? The bitch not, she a bird
Way she act is absurd
I'm her type, yeah, everything she heard
The bitch Cady and I'm Aaron Samuels, October 3rd
You would leave your friends danglin' so you won't look like a nerd
That just mean you'd trade me in if I wasn't the one
Thought she was special how I played her, baby girl, I'm just a flirt
Talk my yeah to the bitch to get under your pink skirt
I'm 'bout the real, lil' baby in a dream world
Thought she was sweet, she just wanna be a mean girl
Said she in love, I don't what that mean, girl
Bitch, you just some plastic and I do them hoes mean, girl
I'm 'bout the real, lil' baby in a dream world
Thought she was sweet, she just wanna be a mean girl
Said she in love, I don't what that mean, girl
Bitch, you just some plastic and I do them hoes mean, girl
