[Intro: Lando Bando]
It's Lando, yo bitch know, don't let yo bitch go, man
It's a whole new wave going on
Them hating niggas wasn't gon' last long, I tried to tell y'all niggas, man
[Verse 1: ShredGang Mone]
Ain't no camera man with this cannon
We'll slide down on them niggas like we scamming
Bounce out on niggas with the motherfucking hammers
Glock right up in his mouth, boy, I'm tryna jam it
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
ShittyBoyz
Russian Drac'll break the bones in yo back
I'm with Strap and Mone, huh, but Mone got the strap
You can't get my heart, gave my soul to the jacks
Upped the roll on the teacher just to throw it at his ass
[Verse 3: ShredGang Mone]
Nigga play with Tron? I'll get to blowing at his ass
Every time I drop some shots, they get to throwing in the flash
White Supreme shirt, north Polo on the back
And my pockets stuffed with slips from the boulders of the pack
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Who not up? Bobby Brown, bitch, you're smoking crack
You can catch me cracking crab legs, punching up the jacks
Feel like Von Miller, catch me jumping on the sack
If I miss, I'm coming rebound, Drummond with the strap
