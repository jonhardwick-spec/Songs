[Intro: BLP KOSHER]
Waterrr
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Waterrr, yeah
[Chorus: BLP KOSHER]
Ayy, I keep the staff, fuck the faculty
Bad bitches eat sweet green, you go to Applebee's
I just bought a Draco with the drum, Jew the
Maccabee
She lookin' at me, stickin' out her tongue, why you mad at me?
Ayy, I keep the staff, fuck the faculty
Bad bitches eat sweet green, you go to Applebee's
I just bought a Draco with the drum, Jew the Maccabee
She lookin' at me, stickin' out her tongue, why you mad at me?
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Baby, we some stars, pop out at night, create a constellation
Thumbin' through the stash, might break the bank, but never concentration
Girly playin' games, I cut into her, call it operation
Choppers waiting, tried to grab a chain, now he a doctors patient
Cudi serving
whatchamacallits I'm talkin' whose he Whozeewhatzit
Getting trippy with my hippie, shroomin' while we Doobie puffin
I got franklins, that's your granny age and I got new B hunnids
Super throated at
LAX
, I almost forgot my Louie luggage
I remember when the wall was my back
And before I learned to walk, I probably crawled to the racks
It's apocalyptical vibes, hit the mall, get attacked
Yeah, I ball, check the stats
I'm the dog getting the cat
What the fuck?
