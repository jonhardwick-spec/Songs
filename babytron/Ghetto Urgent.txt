[Verse 1: Ghetto Baby Boom]
Finna call my doctor, tell her fill me in, this shit urgent (I'm tellin' you)
I need a whole script for fuckin' Perc' 30s (Right now)
Don't ask me 'bout no 10s, they don't work for me (I don't feel the shit)
You know me, I barely sleep, I be up early (I'm up)
Don't ask me what I'm doing, bitch, I'm up working (Gettin' to it)
I pray to God so many times a day like I'm a soldier (Yeah)
They thought the shit was over 'til I got back up on it (Okay then)
You ain't certified, we used to take your lunch money (You lil' dog)
How you acting like you slime? You a damn flunky (Ha)
I can't stand them type of niggas, you gon' tell on me (On everything)
Shooters do that, have bro-bro wipe your hеad for me (My baby)
Yeah, don't need no damn money, you know wе stand on it (Yeah)
I don't want your bitch, that's my bitch, I put my mans on her
She know we play by the rules, she know we ain't saying nothing (Yeah)
Hm, don't worry 'bout it, like who said something? (Fuck nigga)
Oh, them niggas over there? You know they ran from us (Man, stop)
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
They seen that mugshot, ain't know that Tron could get ghetto
You in the store with a dollar, can only get Rellos
You ain't really got a plug on drank, can only get yellow
Mike Amiris, used to be at Burlington to get Ecko
All the guys around me got some green, you'd think I'm with Webbo
Boom in your bushes, pop out like boom
From the womb to the tomb, have my mind on the blues
You are not a drank head, pour a line, you gon' snooze
Free Rich, y'all boys only commit crimes in the booth
Told my brodie spell team, ain't no I, ain't no U
Off a tre-five, had a trippy ride off the shrooms
All these Apple jacks, I could bake a pie with this fruit
If you play with the Militia, get a tie and a suit
Shit, we in a war zone, tell him tie up his boots
So naïve, she can't even tell the lies from the truth
Catch him out speedracing, he gon' die in his coupe
Knew he wouldn't be shit, was in his prime back in school
