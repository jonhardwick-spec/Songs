[Intro: BabyTron]
(
This is a Jay Johnson production

Ayo, Stan, ayy, Dee, we gotta fuck this bitch up
What up, Jay?
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Crip Walking out the bank like I'm Blueface
Fuck hoes, I swear every bitch two-faced
Pray to God everyday, I can't lose faith
Push the pedal to the max, I can't use brakes
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
I don't cheat, I turn up when I start losing
Ninety-nine with the blick, bro a sharp shooter
Should be in Yale, really was a smart student
Now I'm a well known stolen credit card user
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Niggas hate, the K next to me like L
Fuck hitting notes, I can make this bitch yell (On God)
I done seen some shit that I know I can't tell (Shh)
I got off my ass, I wasn't wishing in no well
[Verse 4: StanWill]
Adam22 with it, you is not shooting (No Jumper)
Send a shot dawg way, we is not hooping
Could really start a empire, I am not Lucious
I was raised to be a winner, dawg, I am not losing
