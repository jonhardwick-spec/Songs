[Verse 1: BabyTron]
You can get an average view and play the nosebleeds
Or Spike Lee it, do the right thing and grab a floor seat
CEO, the GM (Brr), you can't coach me
Every time I'm out, I got a pipe like a dope fiend
Tell a bitch my heart don't work, pass a defibrillator
Whole team move the bag around, we facilitators
Shit, I'm chilly mode like I'm sitting in the refrigerator
You ain't really plugged, you in the middle like an instigator
Shit, boy, you couldn't copy this with a printer machine
Feelin' like Houdini, make you poof when the trigger release
Throw that Glock away, you don't look like no killer to me
Throw that Wock' away, you don't look like no sipper to me
Pull up in that Phantom, chop' singing like the opera (Ah)
Dude playing two-faced games, he must be from Gotham
Aimin' with a thousand shots, you better play it like a opossum
Hollows hotter than the sun,
give him heat like I'm DragiÄ‡
[Chorus: Kashif &
BabyTron
]
Ooh-ooh-woah, I want you
You got my love on the rise
Passing strangers in the night
Feeling's comin', comin' alive (
Brr
)
