Backpack Boying, this a three-five of Cherry Chucks
Caught him out, doggy took off, he a scary fuck
I only smoke exotics, I don't care about no Larry Dunn
My bitch twenty-one and she a virgin getting her cherry popped
Habibi out his top, he tryna shoot at every opp
Dropped
a four, Mr. Krabs, I'm moving like I'm Gary now
One of my opps got shot, that nigga acting scary now
Since 2020, I've been smoking Turtle Pie
In some shit you ain't seen, Yamamoto did the jeans
Big B's did the cup, but Quagen did the lean
Asking me for twenty bucks, I think this lil' bitch a fiend
She tryna pay her phone bill, these hoes ain't never got no cheese
Amiri did the jeans, the shoes is Big B
Riding in a Hellcat, it ain't no way I can't speed
Trailing in a Trackhawk, it ain't no way they can't see
You better not pull up on us
You better not pull up by us, because now it's bullets flying
Got the top ticket for these jacks, they some good Verizons
Bitch we rappers, what we doing, all y'all shouldn't try it
If the bank don't deposit this check, I'ma start a riot
I heard that a nigga fucked your bitch and you started crying
Ready to die about it
If I kill a nigga and get caught, I'ma lie about it
You sliding down, shooting up bricks, we don't shoot up houses
I heard a nigga finessed you last week and ain't do shit about it
I told a bitch she couldn't get a bag and she started pouting
A 100k from a fake check cleared and I started shouting
I don't think you've ever seen 10k
I can make that shit ten ways
Boy, I can make that shit in ten days
Let him move a muscle, I'ma let the F&N spray
Shit, I grind from Wednesday to Wednesday
At Bal Harbour, ain't no one with me but Ben Frank
She ain't never seen this drip, keep asking "What those shoes say?"
I wake up looking for bank tools, they the Tuesday
Told the bitch I want to fuck, I'm tryna dive in your pool, ayy
I woke up and made a ten ball, it's a good day
I'm in the studio right now with a good Drac'
I had to kick the cup, but my niggas got good drank
