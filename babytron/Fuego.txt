[Intro: T Bone]
(
AJ, you play too much
)
Yeah
(
Steve-O crowned this beat
)
[Verse 1: T Bone]
Pull up in the low top, bitches like, "Aloha"
This 'za got me movin' 'round like a robot
I got a play for that shit out in Ova
I ain't gon' lie, bitch, I'm so high
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Up thatâ€”, and crack his taco shell
That'd be his last meal, we catch him at the Taco Bell
Arriba, arriba
Ran it up fast in Adidas, my ho drink tequila
[Verse 3: T Bone]
You can't do shit in with me, young dog, I feel like TI
Arriba, arriba, your ho a cheater
She just text my phone, she told me come see her
That chicken, they gon' turn a nigga to a tortilla
I up the chop on an opp, he ran faster than a cheetah
I know a nigga with more stripes than a zebra
Right now I'm chillin' with my vatos
With more cheese on me than your nachos
