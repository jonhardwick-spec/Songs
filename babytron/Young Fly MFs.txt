[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Young fly motherfucker, I might go to DC
Touch at LAX and then I'm headed towards the DT
Somewhere on the beach, gettin' blowed, but it ain't seaweed
She a green light, not no strawberry, just a kiwi
Life's hard, so stop looking for a freebee (Huh, huh, huh)
Shouldn't believe 'em, whoever said it was easy (Huh, huh, huh)
Let a flame out the stick, this bitch a tiki (Huh, huh)
Got a ghetto bitch from south central like Dashiki
I heard the opps been bored, I'm finna put 'em in a Ouija
Full metal jackets for that cappin', put him in his beanie
We was zootin' in that shooter, now I pull up Lamborghini
A wish for a thousand wishеs, I'll scam a genie
Every timе she pop a Perc' with me, she get to actin' freaky
Blowin zoti, cuddy on probation, took a Black and freaked it
Have you ever seen yourself when you looked up at the TV?
Pouring Quagen on my way to Cali, woke up, passin' Phoenix
Rockin' Pradas, totin' blickies, shit, I'm triple strapped at Neiman's
Tryna take out anger, treat the trigger like a hand and squeeze it
He could never come back to this side, we got him banned for treason
Twenty kitties back to back, let's see who got the fastest demon (Huh, huh, huh)
Time to pray for akhi, he'll wack a deacon (Huh, huh, huh)
You ain't durable, you'll miss like half the season (Huh, huh, huh)
Unreleased Gen-6, get blast to pieces (Huh, huh, huh)
(And huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
