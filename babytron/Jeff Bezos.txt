Lyrics from Snippet
[Verse]
...Noddin' off, I’m on my tenth Faygo
Fuck the range, opps' block where we test Dracos
In the jungle, runnin' Amazon like Jeff Bezos
Next time you buy some juice, tell ’em, "Less Karo"
The dog food droppin' fiends, givin' Fent halos
Could've blew you out the water, let the bench play, though
So much gas around, you'd think I hit Sunoco's, then Amoco
Draggin' bags up out the store, last name should be Komodo
I'm on the low-low, catch me out, can’t even get a photo
Click my heels three timems, I’m with the dog, likе Toto
Movin' woozy, sipped a four, but this is not a Loco
Filled my trunk with sneakеr boxes, spent a knot in Nojo’s
Workin' magic with these masters, you ain't got the mojo
Marni button up inside, [?] rock some Polo
I can make it out of town or make it in the city
Better to stack than spend, 'less you can make it in a jiffy
He had two hunnid on his ass, now that’s a quarter ticket
'Cause I caught him out in traffic, sprayed his whip with fifty
First dub, can't even lie, I made it with the giffies
Rollin' 'round with sixty shots, I play it like I'm Nipsey
Yoji Yamamoto's, play these bitches like they Dickies
It ain't no flatwoods or loose leaves, might light a spliffy
Fighting demons in my sleep, feel like they out to get me
You can't do me dirty, even got...
