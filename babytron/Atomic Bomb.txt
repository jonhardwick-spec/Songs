[Intro: BabyTron]
313 MafiaDamn, Glo, you killed this one
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Ninety-nine cent iced tea, five hundred dollar deuce
Step in Dolce & Gabbana, these five hundred dollar shoes
I be with them big sharks, no piranhas 'round me, boo
Atomic bomb, the drop in the pop, I need pajamas, dude
Sleepy than a bitch, I got pieces and they hit
Stan like Keanu Reeves, he be creeping with the blick
Bro J. J. Watt with Glock, if he see you, he gon’ blitz
Dub on me, show my ass like [?] in this bitch
[Verse 2: KrispyLife Kidd]
New sauce, foreign shorts, I'm looking for a MILF
BNT talk, I'll get a little brother killed
Very seldom that I shoot and don’t his shit
Soon as you're done sucking, baby, yeah, I gotta dip
These niggas hoes, it's hard to believe that they got a dick
If I had a Glock, best believe that it got a dick
If yo bitch coming over, duh, she got the dick
And she told you all she did was suck the tip
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Ayy, I could show you how to make some pape, fuck a Forex trade
Turn a opp house to Zap Zone, we gon' score with lasers
Suck a dick, I'll scam yo granny, that was for my haters
Runnin' up up in LA, bitch, we score like Lakers
I eat hibachi everyday, I'm Benihana Man
I'll slam dunk on yo bitch, I’m Juwanna Mann
I know niggas not rich, you ain’t Roddy, man
I can't teach you how to fly but the choppa can
