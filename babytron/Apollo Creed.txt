Ayy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse]
So much bottled up, time to fuck the throttle up
If he won't throw a shot at the opps, he can't rock with us
Where yo baby mama at? I'm tryna get it swallowed up
Creed X Turtle Pie make the bitches follow us
Till I had a blue check, bitches wouldn't follow me
I'ma die punching through this bitch like Apollo Creed
Bitches I stick my dick in, boy, they out yo league
Keeping up with me? That's like jumping without yo knees
Better yet, that's like walking without yo feet
You laying on a futon, I'm somewhere walking on the beach
I'ma need 1K, I'm not talking for the free
He was talking out his ass, now he's talking to my feet
Don't shit last forever but the money in my pocket
Hakeem Olajuwon, bitch, I'm coming in with rockets
If we don't stomp him, we gon' pop him
If we stomp him, we gon' roll
.223s make his funky-ass Pop, Lock & Drop It
Bitches tryna take pictures, you are not paparazzi
If the gang not around me then the fucking choppa got me
Thinking that he balling? Fuck around and leave him stuck like Rodney
Feel like Ricky Bobby,
SRT
, this not a Maserati
Sent my bitch in with a punch, she like Ronda Rousey
Flying 'round with that iron on me, bitch, I'm Robert Downey
If it's money on yo head then it's death, it's not a bounty
This a four of Wockhardt in my cup, I'm sounding drowsy
That's what yo ham-ass'll say after we K word you
Beam on a super charge Glock, we'll Halo you
How the fuck are you the plug and you ain't mobile?
This moon rock a motherfucker, got me up in space floating
Everybody 'round me look foreign, feel like Mark Cuban
No love like a robot, am I part human?
She heard one lil' song then she start choosing
When you got the BIN that I got, yeah, yo car's boosting
Huh, and yo car fool
Yo big-ass gang got one whip, that's why yo car full
Damn, choppa make 'em cartwheel
Twenty-three off the blues, balling like a Tar Heel
You look soft in that BAPE, boy, my sharks kill
I done been through some shit and ain't a part heal
If the fucking Visa don't hit, the Mastercard will
All that motherfucking dick sucking, I'm a star still
If I catch you out talking shit, I'ma whoop yo ass
If Stan catch an opp with the blick, he gon' cook his ass
Just got in a parking lot brawl and I Suge'd his ass
Just went Vin Diesel on 12 and I shook they ass
Hut one, hut two, I just scored a touchdown
They got the sad face, boy, they mad as fuck I'm up now
She used to be a spinner, that shit crazy, she a slut now
Big drip cause a hurricane if I jump 'round
Come on, I got some shit to say
The old me dead and gone, I feel like Justin Timberlake
I ain't a shrimp but I get shrimp when I get it with the steak
I think I need a QP, I like the lemon pepper taste
I can fly a bitch wherever like whenever
Off-White, Balenciaga, look better together
This Alexander, yes, I'm just flexing the sweater
If you really want smoke, okay, I'm pressing whether
