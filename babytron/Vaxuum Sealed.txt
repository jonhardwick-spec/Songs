[Intro: Drego]
Boy
(
Meech
)
Man
[Chorus: Drego &
Beno
]
I ain't gon' lie, I ain't shit without my vacuum seal
Young nigga slap dope and I tax on pills
Young nigga just tryna get his Buffalo Bills
I was twenty-one when I had a quarter mil'
Get your bitch, she eat dick, she ain't got no chill
You was a bitch back in the day, you a ho still
Heard the block got too hot, trap out the hotel
Mix the cheese with the beef like it's Rotel
[Verse 1: Beno]
Get your bitch, she on my D-I
Yeah, I be with five niggas, bitch, like I'm B.I. (On Bloods)
Made a hundred thou' on the road in a Nissan
Had niggas runnin' 'round givin' tips like they T.I.
[Verse 2: Drego &
Beno
]
Kinky freaky bitch, I'm pullin' down her knee-highs
I watched her snort three lines, Adidas
She let me fuck, then I threw her ass the peace sign
Man, these niggas sell they soul for a cosign
I'll turn your bag up like a doorknob
I sent her out with the dog, that's a blowjob
Nigga all on my dick, that's his ho job
I done ran through more scripts than Beaumont
Get the bag to you quicker than Jimmy Johns
Who done caught more bodies than 50â€” shh
The load on timeout, I keep it quiet for the vacuum seal
