[Verse 1: TrDee]
You've been actin' different ever since I got some money
Ain't no way you think I'm lackin', you ain't takin' nothin' from me
I was walkin' through that rain, know I'm grateful that it's sunny
You know I'm a ShittyBoy, got paper on me like a mummy
Bitch, if you ain't heard of me, then you must be deaf
Brodie pull up with that Glockie up on him tryna be Steph'
Watch how you approach me, he gon' crash out just like Bandicoot
He ain't know that me and gang be shootin' like the camera crew
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Choppa
light this beef
, that bitch'll rock a nigga head
I heard doggy snitchin', we don't politick with feds
Better not say it's up, 'cause it ain't drop until he dead
When we hop out GLE, she hoppin' in my bed
Catch him out in traffic, we gon' stop him like a red
Boy, I give your ho the dopest dick, I pop her like some meds
When I'm up in Somerset, you know it's fuck a budget
How Militia step on shit, they think we double dutchin'
[Chorus: FMB DZ &
GlockBoyz TeeJaee
]
Thirty rackades for the chain, you know the pendant flooded
A hundred thousand on me right now, it's just me and Bloody
I like my sodas muddy, don't show my homies money
That pistol in the party, you run up on me, I'm gon' bust youIt's just me and bro, we both got stick, we double clutchin'I woke up and made like twenty thousand cash, that shit wasn't nothin'
