[Intro]
What up, Mark?
(
Ayo, Mark A
)
[Verse 1]
In the UFO off moon rock, I might be a Martian
'Gelo and Lamelo, me and D hitting threes in Charlotte
You won't see me out unless you catch me leaving Neiman Marcus
I'll flash a long-sleeve, let me take the sleeve and park it
Coffee cup full of Wock' and pop, this ain't Tim Horton's
Before my face card was hot, I had been scorching
Steak fiend, this the third time this week I hit Morton's
Whip roaring, hopping out 'Iagas, only drip foreign
Track one, step it, track one, swipe it
Road running, shoutout Yachty, think that I'ma one night it
Scat Pack with the wasp, finna buzz by 'em
Where the tester at? I told your ass that these some Hutch diamonds
Woke up, made a dub, you ain't even brush your teeth yet
Hundred rounder just so he don't get the chance to cheat death
If I slide down, it's only gon' be some debris left
12 on the right, dumbass, you gotta swing left
What I learned is backdoors is something you can't leave open
Chopstick, every shot auto, guess I'm free throwing
High as hell 'cause the weed and the drink potent
Bumped into Peezy up in Hutch, he told me, "Keep going"
