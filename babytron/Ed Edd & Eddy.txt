[Intro: StanWill]
Bitch, I ain't—, hold on
She gon' rip me out my—
She gon' rip me out my, yeah, yeah
(
Ooh, shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
That's a—that's a Danny G beat, bitch
She gon' rip me out my Yoh'
Huh, huh
[Verse 1: StanWill]
She gon' rip me out my Yohji Yamamoto coat
Winnin' now, they tryna act like they don't know the score
Up the broom and sweep the opps, they think we 4 and O
He tryna keep her in the barn, I guess he know his ho the G.O.A.T
Playin' tug-of-war with your ho, all these ropes on me
Funny how they say I look like Snoop, boy, I'll smoke homie
We don't fuck with deuces, boy, it's fours only
You would think they hit me with the switchie, all thеse hoes on me
Mе and Tron Zach and Cody, ain't shit sweet at all
Lookin' at my MRI, boy, you gon' see a dog
Ed, Edd and Eddy, we got your bitch eatin' balls
Through these icy mirror-tinted Cartis, I done seen it all
Pole made him strip, think my opps work at Truth
Lyin' through his lips, be done popped him in his tooth
If you see me with it, then my niggas got it too
Shit, we crammed up in the whip, got bitches hoppin' out of coupes
