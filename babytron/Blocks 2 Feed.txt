[Chorus: YSR Gramz]
The reason why I go so hard, I got blocks to feed
Nigga, you a bag of Doritos, that is not yo cheese
Brodie in the corner with a shot like he Jodie Meeks
Nappy head nigga trip on beats like ODB
The reason why I go so hard, I got blocks to feed
Nigga, you a bag of Doritos, that is not yo cheese
Brodie in the corner with a shot like he Jodie Meeks
Nappy head nigga trip on beats like ODB
[Verse 1: YSR Gramz]
I'll treat a nigga like Craig, nigga, go to sleep
LeBron James of the rap game, I'm the MVP
I'm the trapper of the year, I got ETD
We slap twenty bowls out this crib, me and LBG
I got some strong-ass weed but it smell like feet
We just bought three more choppas 'cause we smell beef
I'm finna put my hood on like that nigga Keef
Nigga, watch that car, who was that in that SUV?
Black Forces on, I don't steal but I hang with thieves
Blew his ass down with FN, that nigga flew like leaves, ha-ha
You know I'm going brazy
I remember I was a lil' nigga, we had a 380
This nigga in the crib fucked up watching three babies
His BM mad as fuck
She thought she had a winner on her team, she thought she lucked up
