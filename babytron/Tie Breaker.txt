[Verse 1: Prince Jefe]
My life gucci, but my shirt is Louis
You brought your strap, let's get into it, Blasian bitch look like Karrueche
Brown skin like JT, I roll with the Uzi
Please don't talk that murder shit to me, you ain't been in no shootings
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Yohji Yamamoto, Mike Amiris, or it's RTA
Doggy think that he a trap star 'cause he got Carti frames
Taking risks, pulling stunts, live the gnarly way
Hundred-shotter clear the party out and I hardly aim
[Verse 3: Prince Jefe]
Thirty shots in fifty seconds, you can't get away
You gon' get your ass whacked tryna get my chain
I grab a new batch from my plug and I do my thang
We not leaving 'til we see blood tap a nigga face
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Shit, went from Humanrace to the SBs
This a Glocky with a switch, like fuck a XD
Shit, if the risk high, so is the reward
Mixing magic potions, this a four, I feel like Dumbledorе
[Verse 5: Prince Jefe]
You keep fucking off your racks, but what you hustle for?
My lawyer pissed, shе smell the pack when I walk in court
Cracking BoAs, you get fifty if you give me yours
Hit his block, two-fifty shots, boy, you know when it rain, it pours
