[Intro]
You ever been to a haunted house?
Nyah
Hey
Hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
Take a step into this haunted house
Once you enter it, it ain't no walkin' out
We just moved in, I pay my killer to install the couch
Why you still on the porch? Shit, you must've thought about it
Lookin' like a werewolf, Marni slips cost a thousand
Life a nightmare, I'm fallin' in and out it (Shit, I'm fallin' in and out it)
Chop his head off, bring it to the crib, and mount it
Watch the brick disappear like a phantom, it's astounding
[Verse]
Ghost Glockies on the table, Casper choppers on the dresser
Throw 'em in a lake and leave 'em at the bottom with the treasure
No pads on, gang catch constant interceptions
It'd be a spooky night, I got some monsters for the steppers
Zombie tips'll turn him into rotten flesh
ARP just sung a lullaby, we laid an opp to rest
We'll leave him with some flowers by his headstone
Bitch say I'm it, but I don't think I got a red nose
Fully sound like a chainsaw, hm
Fully sound like a chainsaw, they think it's Leatherface
Evil than a fuck, I'll probably to—
Evil than a fuck, I'll probably tote the pole through Heaven gates
Put him in a coffin, then we celebrate
Granny thinks I'm psychotic, says I need to medicate
Burned his body up, we ain't leave nothin' to investigate
Think we out the way, whole time we workin' out of Section 8
Flyin' by the digs with a switch, free project
Flyin' with a— Green Goblin
Oh, he think he Spiderman? He better stay by Uncle Ben
We'll turn him to a nightcrawler, serve your uncle fent'
Hellraiser, you would think I'm Pinhead
Count von Count, add it up while I sip red
Should I pick the embosser up, wipe off the cobwebs?
Lil' ho from Hell, whole time thought she was godsent
Firebombed they spot, they probably thinkin' it was Lucifer
I know Martians that'll catch a hat, speed off to Jupiter
Buffies look like two bones, it's a skellie on my wrist
Pelle jeans, it's a thousand dead presis in these shits
We'll make it dark in the daytime
Finna slide like the park, but it ain't playtime
Shit, I'm tryna dodge the narcs and the K9s
Steppin' in this haunted house, ain't leanin' towards the safe side
