[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Finna let my soul bleed like the soles on my kicks
Off-White, I might O.D. putting on my drip
Expensive habits, eighty dollars, spent it on some shrimp
Rap star, riding incognito, hit the road with tint
Hutch shopper, had to go and rose gold the kit
Turning in, got Sprint looking like a dojo with bricks
Boss dinner, meet the whole gang and Fogo's at six
Hopping out with sticks looking like we pogo with blicks
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Redbone slim thick, she my Coi Leray
Heard a opp got dropped, hip-hip-hooray
Unc' been in the kitchen for a minute, he like Bobby Flay
I'ma do my thang 'cause they gon' hate a nigga anyway
Baby, I'm a star, you cannot treat me like them other lames
I'm not in FaZe, but she hatе that I be playing games
Had to tell hеr, "I can't cuff you 'cause you all the same"
Dripping like a faucet only 'cause I made it through the rain
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Turnt it up a notch 'cause they ain't hear your baby
I be moving smarter so these niggas can't get near your baby
Seven hunnid horses why I steer so crazy
I might throw a stack of dog shit where my ear located
Chilling in the 'burbs but my ears where the streets be
It's a dirty game, I can't let nobody cheat me
Scat Packing up the Lodge, nigga, beep-beep
'Miri's off the Goose, bet yo bitch let me beat cheeks
