(Intro)
Aye I'm back bitch, the goat
You know that light shit, let me show you
ShittyBoyz!!
(Verse)
Cut it out boy how you stabbin’ in that ford
Foolin in the scat drivers smackin on they horn
Play yo cards with it cause bro reactin with the torch
Quarterback with it he a pass em to the lord
What i'm sayin' is we’ll send dog to outer space
I been ballin too long I need a Powerade
We 5 deep with 5 sticks thats a power play
Upped the roll on the teacher left her with the sour face
ShittyBoyz broke? what's in that blunt?
Metta World Peace with this piece ima punch
Nigga if it's cheese in the air ima jump
If she bend over Spud Webb ima dunk
I just punched an iPhone X off this Android
If you smokin' moonrock I guess i'm smokin astroid
Been undefeated with the punches you can ask Floyd
Lil dog said he need a punch so ima tax boy
Lil Bitch choosin cause I ball like LaMelo
Back was on the ropes had to punch like Canelo
Red bottom drip, my bitches steppin in stilettos
That is not glue boy thats reggie in that rello
BabyTron the punch god I am not human
In love with these juggs you can go and ask Cupid
Look at you and look at me of course she chose stupid
Touchdown on these niggas feelin like i'm Cam Newton
Woke up wantin steak im finna hit Morton's
You woke up with 3 bucks get some Tim Hortons
I just wanna thank god that my BIN's scorchin
Facecard on fire you woulda thought my bitch foreign
Brush that shit off, took some L’s to the chin
Cause it ain’t no “I” in lose, it's in “I” in “Win”
Them dumps a motherfucka when you get em with the pin
LOL ham ain’t shit fire bout yo BIN
The shoes on yo foot don't match the energy you got
100 pack on me and they all finna pop
2 thumbs down man the opps off the Nike flops
It's winter time now this broke shits gotta stop
30 on the stick let it rip like a Beyblade
Ima catch the play for some green feel like AJ
Got a play Friday after Next feel like Day Day
You are not slick you only up that shit on pay day
Footwork butter it's the 350’s
Dunk contest when I see the feds hit a 360
Bro had 1 piece walked out with 3 Gifty's
Can't tell you what we did comin' through them 3 cities
Right arm was broke but still jammin with my left hand
Fight who? Fight where? Nigga this ain't Def Jam
I'll put dog in a suit like a best man
If I can't fuck that bitch I bet my nigga Jeff can
Ain't Virginia Tech but it's a V on the tee
Yes bitch it's me Mr. get it for the free
Want some food huh? Punchin up some UberEats
Slow it down girl oou you a superfreak
On the MSR the only time that I write shit
Kappa Joggy hit for 5 oou that's some light shit
On the road at midnight you rather do a night shit
Askin' all these questions ima put that shit like this
No you can't get a method, No you can't get a site
No you can't get the sauce, No i'm not finna fight
No they not really up, please don't believe the hype
Fast ass life boy you know the package overnight
