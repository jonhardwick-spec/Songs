[Intro: Talibando]
Yeah
Navy shit
You know what the fuck it is, nigga
Fuck with my nigga Tron in this bitch, nigga, fuck it is
[Verse 1: Talibando]
You gotta make the money, bitch, don't let the money make you (Yeah)
On I-75 goin' south, dodgin' the state troops
I can get the bag in any town, make it shake too (For real)
I found out they payin' triple here, this was a great move (Great move)
Everybody with me eatin' pull a chair up to the table (No cap)
Watchin' cameras in the spot and we ain't even got no cable (Yeah)
I just poured up some Quagen, this shit thicker than some maplе (Ah)
Just left out Revive, I'm fish-tailin' down Maplе (Skrrt)
I'm really takin' off on niggas, put the pedal to the floor (For real)
My cuddy comin' down from Flint he just want a couple 'bows (Come on)
If you see me in the club, just know I snuck my gun in (Fah-fah)
All my ice on, chillin' at the bar, gettin' lit (Yeah)
Nigga play crazy, I'm like granny, hit him with the switch (Brrt)
Walk him down, get up close, I ain't into no attempts (Naw)
Send a bitch to get a bag and bring it back like I'm a pimp (I am)
Smoke exotic by the 'bow, if I like it, I'ma buy it all
Rolled a 'Wood so big, the bitch thought I was smokin' on cigars
In the stu' makin' sales, BabyTron punchin' cards
