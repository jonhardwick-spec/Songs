[Intro: MJPAID]
(
Ooh, it's BlueStrip, baby
)
Gang
672 shit, nigga, your bitch knew that, though
Long live the PA prince
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
[Verse 1: MJPAID]
Shit, even through the smoke shit, I gotta navigate through it
You ain't really punchin' shit, who the fuck you foolin'?
Wock' hella thick, where the ice? I'm just tryna cool it
And I gotta make some bands 'fore I make some music
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Shit, you gotta make a thousand before you spend a hundred
It's 2023, you finally got a car you press the button
Fuck scorin' only twenty-nine, I need an extra bucket
Sit on the sideline, young bull, the legends run it
[Verse 3: MJPAID]
LAX, chillin' with thе Louis luggage
And she know I hit her friеnd, still gon' do me, fuck it
Life shit low-key hurt, but you gotta love it
Walk in the store with fake ID, bitch, I got McLovin
Bank ran out of blues, now I gotta dub it
Off of shrooms and deuce, how I'm finna function?
Why the fuck you got a chain if you tryna tuck it?
Nigga, I ain't runnin' from a challenge, I just get it custom
