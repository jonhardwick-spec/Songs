[Intro]
You're not makin' this easy, Kyle
[Chorus]
Nose runnin', shit, I shouldn't of took a break from juice
Double, triple, quadruple, shit, I made a eight from two
Nose runnin', shit, I shouldn't of took a break from juice
Double, triple, quadruple, shit, I made a eight from two
[Verse]
Tryna tell me game, but I'm hip like a femur
Black and white Bathing Ape fully zipped, I'm a lemur
ARP got some kick, make him twitch like a streamer
Got the drop from his rental plug, we tryna find the
Bimmer
Actin' like Lil Baby, that don't work, you got four pockets flat
Ironic brodie caught it, when hе hit him, doggy dropped his hat
Skinnies with the rippеd, zombified like I got attacked
Life a movie script, but I promise I am not a act
Got the case dropped without a scratch, that's an Otterbox
Cuddy should've copped a coolin' kit, he got the chopper hot
Do my shooters shoot? That's like askin' if a locker lock
Caught a play in Syracuse and stopped at the Copper Top
Get his dog dropped with one button like a shock collar
Eyes low as fuck, but the za', I pay top dollar
One, two, skip a few, ninety-nine, one hundred
I'm a baller, got my overall to ninety-nine from nothin'
Diamonds on my neck, they water, boy, Bobby Boucher
Had a Stilpane weekend, it's a Wocky Tuesday
By 2025, I'm tryna sell out Little Caesars
BabyTron, you know me, posin' with two middle fingers
Being poor an illness and you don't need a diagnostic
If you saw me runnin', must've also seen a flyin' ostrich
Mad I used to call dog my dawg, really, he a pussy
Actin' like he ball on Hall of Fame, really, he a rookie
Before I shroom up, grab my passport, I'm finna trip
Nose runny as a bitch, it take some Tris, need a sip, I'm feelin' sick
(You're not makin' this easy, Kyle)
