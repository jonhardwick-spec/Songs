[Part I]
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Throwbacks and Backwoods, it's even opps in the raw paper (Fuck)
State to state tourin', shit, I'm feelin' like a ball player
Fourth quarter, I'll get you dropped like a jawbreaker
For a hundred, I'll get you blue like a Ben Frank' (A blue hundred? Come on now)
Pocket full of dead presis, walk around, feelin' like Larenz Tate
I need to get up out the mall, I got the urge to spend pape'
[Verse 2: TrDee &
BabyTron
]
I'm scrapin' the bottom, arm in it, look like Vince Carter
How the fuck you can't tell who winnin'? Bitch, look harder
She call mе, "Daddy," her daddy think he got a good daughter
Stop thе cappin', you not plugged in like a loose charger
In the Bahamas, smokin' opps with a Brazilian model
I know you sick as fuck, your money short like Hornswoggle
Baby hit me with that head that made my legs wobble
He made it to the spital but was dead on arrival (
Shit
)
[Verse 3: BabyTron &
TrDee
]
Pots and pans ain't for me
I was on the 'Gram, blockin' hams, makin' cheese (Brrt)
You was in the field, but now you not, Drew BreesThis my first time in this bitch, man, I gotta speed
