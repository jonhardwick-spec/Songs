Ayy, huh, yeah
Yeah (
Damn, Vito, what you cookin' up?
)
Big Chick ridin' 'round with the ShittyBoyz
Yeah, ayy
Ayy
[Verse 1: Chicken P]
It's Big Chick, yeah, bitch, I'm with the ShittyBoyz
By the store with two chains on like Tity Boi
I'll make a bad bitch eat dick 'til she dizzy
I don't watch Digimon, I drop grams on my digi', boy
I'll take the shh off theâ€”, make it make plenty noise
Whole car, what you roll down the window for?
Pass me my coat, brought the Drakey with me in the store
Made a ten, then looked back at my bitch like, "We finna go"
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Twenty-eight Amiris, dubs show, got me pigeon-toed
Playbook out, should I pick-and-roll or give-and-go?
My Blood cousin seen me up the blues like, "What you Crippin' for?"
Nitro in the engine of this fucker, so the whip gon' float
Scoring back to back in them stores, where's my Grand Badge?
AR with the titties on it, shoot it 'til my hand cramp
Glock got a drum on that bitch like it's Bandcamp
Got some hot heads, set the play and get 'em ransacked
