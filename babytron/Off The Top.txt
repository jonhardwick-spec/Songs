[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Crunchwrap supreme with diablo sauce
I ain't talking ’bout no food, that's just how I talk
Call you "Chum Bucket", walk around without the sauce
I should be a motherfucking dentist, that's just how I floss
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Dog shit, I done came with the dookie roll
Super slick, played the lil’ bitch like a movie roll
Man, I'm sick and tired of you goofy hoes
Chopstick next to the pape', that's a sushi roll
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Heard them niggas looking for me, tell them boys I'm ready
Looking at my mans like, "Is yo shoot hand steady?"
If we ain't fucking, we ain't talking, yes, this shit can get petty
Call [?] when he shoot, he a lefty
[Verse 4: Biltmore Peeko]
I'll leave a nigga hating like a Nazi
Bitch, I’m with the gang and I see you with the posse
I’m shooting up your street, I'm looking like a zombie
I shot a oldhead ’cause he was fucking with my mommy
