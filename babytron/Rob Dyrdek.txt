[Intro: StanWill]
25/8, huh, 25/8, on my grind like I'm Dyrdek
Goddamn, huh
Yeah, bitch
[Verse 1: StanWill]
25/8, on my grind like I'm Dyrdek
Balling up his fist? Doggy bone must not fear death
Cut the traction off and punch the gas while I steer left
Can't hear you, got some dog shit where my ear at
Off-White hoodie with the scribble like it's art class
She ain't got no morals, she gon' fuck me 'cause my car fast
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Used to be black
, now it's Chrome where my heart at
Wild Rum, Lemon Pound Cake, I'm where the stars at
Medusa on the drawers, bitch, these ain't Polo boxеrs
Today is crab legs and steak, I don't want no lobster
Downtown for somе SBs, I'm a Nojo shopper
Talking 'bout the mafia and you don't even know no mobsters
[Verse 3: TrDee]
We don't save hoes, this ain't the Justice League
Stan'll really set the play, I call him "Andy Reid"
Bitch think I'm leaving when we done, I said I am indeed
Gang on the block sending shots like Joel Embiid
L's make a champ, I shrug my shoulders if I take a loss
Hope yo bitch don't throw the pussy 'cause I turn to Randy Moss
