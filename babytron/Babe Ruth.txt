[Intro]
(
Damn, Machu, why'd you have to do 'em like that?
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
I'ma make her suck it while I'm driving like I got tint
Stop acting grown, bitch, you acting like you got rent
Let it cock back then I'ma attack it like I'm Josh Smith
You could be with God in that Scat, you can't dodge this
Cut the lights off just to show her these them one diamonds
And I be in them rentals 'cross the country yelling fuck mileage
Bitch, I'm fly as hell off these Visas, I'm a punch pilot
Red beam on it, crazy that I had enough timing
Bitch, I'm up-up, I can honey dip like VC
Really jugg stuff, making money flip off GCs
Scrub the tub up, told the maid to make it clean pleasе
Mike Amiri, Ksubis, or the Purples, I'm a jеan fiend
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Stan probably punched a mark grip with the green beam
It's a bougie day, I'm feeling steak and some green beans
Tron facing Gary too, he looking like he lean-lean
I be getting chicken, I am not selling wing dings
Pics you double tapping, me and gang done probably ran through
Came from the bottom and I bet you that you can too
I don't wanna shoot 'em but I really think my hand do
I don't wanna fuck but I really think my mans do
But I might
We coming through with choppas, why you think we finna fight?
Why would I quit rapping when I see a M in sight?
They outside with them sticks, you would've thought they went on strike
