[Intro]
(
Thank you, GC
)
(
Yo, you turnt, PJ
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Yeah, bro, you turnt but ain't turnt like me
Face card good everywhere, ain't gotta show ID
Wouldn't even know that she be fuckin', bitch so lowkey
I'ma show up every time you need me, you can count on me
I been runnin' up my bands, all you do is run your mouth
I ain't finna throw no hands, just let Glocky knock you out
I done fucked a couple fans, they like what I be rappin' 'bout
She can't get another chance, spinnin' in the blender now
Stick on me watchin' TV, I guess I'm paranoid
When they callin' tell me that they got him, I'ma jump for joy
I ain't even did nothin' to 'em, why thеy hate your boy?
Dawg talk a lot for a nigga that ain't makin' noise
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Talkin' 'bout some Yеrcs, you popped a five, boy, that's a microdose
Shit
I'm too attached to Wocky, better hide your potion
I'll do the bitch you call white trife so bogus
Out here actin' loosey-goosey, need to find your focus
Nine minutes after ten, that's what time it is
Slide with five F&Ns, that's what time it is
All that lyin', you gon' die in the den, that's what time it is
That's what time it is, that's the life I live
Couldn't even kill a blunt of 'za, I put a strap away
Better back away, before I activate
Floatin' in that Bumblebee, got punch work like Cassius Clay
I don't need no plastic for this trip, I'ma tap to pay
