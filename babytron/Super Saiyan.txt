[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy,
ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Ball so hard you would've thought we bought VC
Hit the road and brought the phones home, feel like E.T
Punches too fire, feel like Goku on the GCs
Bitch, I'm plugged in like a Roku on the TV
350 Boost the only time we do Adidas
Piece hit for over nine thousand, that's Vegeta
Balenciaga runners, last year we did Arenas
The opps can't see me, you can call me "Tron Cena"
Coach always told me, "When they reach, boy, you gotta teach"
Go ahead and reach for this chain, Heaven's kinda steep
Deep-Range Deadeye with the tool, bro shooting threes
Walking ATM, it's dog shit in these Amiri jeans
It's 5 AM and I'm still up, nah, literally
The way I stepped out, you woulda thought I came from Italy
Play my roll now for all the times she was spinning me
Human Races dripping, y'all fits be killing me
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Play after play, I'm a walking highlight
Punch after punch, life feel like Fight Night
Bro tryna beef? Nigga, you should fight life
You can only get the sauce free for the right price
256 on that XS max
Heard it's phones on the floor, I'm gon' run to the jacks
'Cause if I ever fall, they gon' run to my back
Ray Lewis in the field, bitch, I run to the sack
Got the eye of the tiger in this Kenzo tee
SB
, man, the gang can depend on me
All strips in a roll, ain't no tens on me
Every play you can catch me where the end zone be
I'll take dawg out the game like a technical
Bitch see I ball, now she all on my testicles
Hoes ain't loyal, they'll leave you right from next to you
Jump up, bro'll blow that head off the rest of you
