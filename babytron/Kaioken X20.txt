[Intro: BabyTron]
Stuntman, stuntman
(RJ Always Trippin' man)
I'm always trippin' too, I always tell you that
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
R.I.P lil' Chris, put this shit on bro and 'em
In Chirac with dreadheads that's on foenem
Mirror tint flashy than a bitch, I see the hoe in 'em
What's that on yo hip? That's a pistol, we be toting' 'em
Commitin' homicide, doors, they do suicides
Happy than a bitch with my slime, we done threw a 5
Goofy [?], give a fuck if you inside
Get the pussy if it’s kinda good, do it two more times
Black ass sock runners, I can slip and slide in ‘em
Jeff that’s my kin, ‘012 was flippin' dimes with him
How you get the money out my card? I gave you 9 digits"
"That’s what hams say, if you oppin', then yo times tickin'
Tsk, and yo Rollie too
This bitch a freak, got her loose off the 42
Tsk, have you еver seen these Goldеn Goose?
Do you know who I am? Mr. Throw-The-Oop
Mr. Get-The-Head-From-Her, then I stand in her friend [?]
StanWill, LJ, that’s a lot of dreadlocks
Caught the opps ten deep, that’s ten cops
Might turn into the fuckin' demon off this red pop
