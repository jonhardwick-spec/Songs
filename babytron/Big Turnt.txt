[Intro: BabyTron]
Huh
Bitch, I'm Mr. Go Up In The Store, huh
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bitch, I'm Mr. Go Up In The Store, Jam The Chip Then Dip
Told brodie stop the scam shit, I'm a hypocrite
Sick did the F&N jam, did the pistol whip
Turban off the foreign sneaks, looking like a immigrant
I know you sick you work a six-to-six
RTAs off the Goose coat, got the blick equipped
Exclusive drop on Melrose, you can't get this drip
Punch God, I ain't never ever once flip the zip
[Verse 2: YSR Gramz]
Robbed a nigga yesterday, he got pistol whipped
I got dog shit like I slipped in shit
3.5 in my 'Wood, this bitch thick as shit
I'll beat a nigga ass like a instrument
.223s make a nigga Jeff Hardy flip
Hе let a nigga sell him fake-ass drank and I know hе sick
I went to school with that nigga, man, I know he bitch
I got all blues on me but I'm not no Crip
[Bridge: BabyTron]
Fuck, shit, damn
Huh, huh, yeah
