[Intro: StanWill]
(
It's with a K, dumbass
)
Bitch, yeah, yeah, huh
[Verse 1: StanWill]
I rep SB and Yeezy Mafia
I don't need no love, bitch, I just need some oxygen
I don't need no love, just a bitch to be toxic with
On the opp block with heavy metal, brodie rocking shit
Japanese BAPE, stick tucked, I'm a scamurai
Talk shit, punch drip, live a scammer life
You would think I'm Asgardian, keep the hammer tight
If yo granny sweet, I'ma scam her twice
Sick of fighting so I bought a glizzy, I got Glock on me
Nah, for real, it's busting out the skinnies, see the Glock poking
Tryna be like us and he went broke, hit the jock on him
Talking all that zaza shit? Boy, that's not potent
[Verse 2: KrispyLife Kidd]
Damn, Stan, yeah
That shit is not potent, my nigga got some kush
Regular, okay, KrispyLife
If I hit the gas too hard then my whip'll fly
My shoes bald at the bottom, I'm finna slide
Hit a nigga hood and commit genocide
If you riding with the opps then you finna die
Ain't no going back and forth, bitch, yeah, pick a side
Open yo legs up, baby, I'm putting pills and dick inside
I hit this bitch for so long, I left a dent inside
Nah, I hit this bitch for so long, I left my print inside
No hoes on yo FUBU sweater, I'm a designer
Nigga, look like J.Lo did it
Yeah, I handed dawg so much sherm, he got a halo, didn't he?
Want a fifteen song EP? Then pay me fifty
Wanna show you the sauce but I be too busy
Get a couple [?] low 350
I'm done drinking lean, I want my kidneys
Whip a brick faster than you can count to twenty
