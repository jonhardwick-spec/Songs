[Verse 1: TrDee]
I'll leave the game and come back like I'm Paul Pierce
I ignore haters, if it's money, I'm all ears
Baby head a ten and the pussy so fierce
You niggas not around when you losing, don't hear no cheers
You gon' see days when you up, days when you down
Past messed me up, when I'm happy I don't even smile
They gon' suck the game up like a fucking towel
You cannot just get this overnight, boy, it's gon' take a while
I been balling for a minute, told my coach I need a breather
It can be the еnd of May, I'm still around with the heater
I can only sеll you sauce, I do not come with a teacher
Woke up in that type of mood to wear my chain with just a beater
Pull up with a bad redbone, [?]
Shout-out Chris Smoove, if you reach then I gotta teach
I can show you how I get it, I don't like to preach
Yes, black lives do matter, tell 'em free Big Meech
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Game face on, where the pape'? I ain't playing games
I'm getting life if it's that, bitch, I ain't saying that
Buffed up eating steaks, still ain't even gaining weight
If it ain't 10K plus, dude, throw the play away
I need a 'bow of za, where the fuck is [?] at?
You kissing on her pretty little face, that's where I jizz at
You up a hunnid but your brother broke, where is his at?
This some Wockhardt, you sipping beer out asix pack
Steph Curry walking in the Chase, that's a easy three
Wearing Crocs around some millionaires, I'm just being me
Pull up on your bitch, I'm in her walls like a BNE
Missed twenty-something money calls, phone on DND
Talking choppy, got the chop tucked, don't get chopped up
Yo bitch a whore, gang shooting shot, she ain't swat once
If I hear it's in the air, boy, you better not jump
Big loaf in these 'Miri jeans, heard you got crumbs
Ooh, you a filthy guy
Caught him in a orange Scat Pack and we peeled his ride
Smiling for the dubs but all them L's still inside
If I put the coupe in sports mode then this bitch gon' fly
Tell my brothers they can call on me if they ever down
Twenty-something deep in the function, got them steppers 'round
Ex bitch swore she was shitting, heard she jealous now
Heard bitcoin finna drop, I might sell it now
