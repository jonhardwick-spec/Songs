[Intro: BabyTron]
Brr (Yeah)
Brr (Yeah), brr
Brr (Yeah), brr
Brr (Yeah), brr
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good in the Bronx, boy, I'm good where you at?
Boy, you good with the Josh, boy, I'm good with the Drac'
Pulled this bitch out my BAPE, you get put in yo' place
Yeah,
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Milita
, this shit a global takeover, you know what the fuck goin' on man
You're not makin' this easy, Kyle
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Drop an ash on my shirt, high as hell, spillin' soda
Number one seed every year, Villanova
Lil' gang caught hats then come with the 'plomas (Ah)
Purple thigh pads on, Minnesota
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Good in the Bronx (Yeah)
Good where you at? Boy, you good with the Josh
Boy, I'm good with the Drac' (Brr)
Pullеd this bitch out my BAPE, you get put in yo' place
Full of dead man, dеad man 'Wood, this an eighth
I just called hangtime
Three fizzy, three five, I'm a faze mind
We gon' slide, moonlight to the daytimes
Splashed up, boy, I'll let some pape' fly
Shit, yo' lane dry
Unk in the kitchen, masked up with the K9
See my mans tryna cross me, all them fake vibes
Had to stand over dog like AI
If you got some real pape', go 'head, say, "I"
(Shit, say, "I")
(If you got some real pape', then say, "I")
(Shit, say, "I")
(If you got some real pape', shit, say, "I")
Good in the Bronx (Yeah)
Good where you at? Boy, you good with the Josh
Boy, I'm good with the Dracs' (Brr)
Pulled this bitch out my BAPE, you get put in yo' place
Full of dead man, dead man 'Wood, this an eighth
I just called hangtime
Three fizzy, three five, I'm a faze mind
We gon' slide, moonlight to the daytimes
Splashed up, boy, I'll let some pape' fly
Shit, yo' lane dry
Unk in the kitchen, masked up with the K9
See my mans tryna cross me, all them fake vibes
Had to stand over dog like AI
If you got some real pape', go 'head, say, "I"
(Shit, say, "I")
(If you got some real pape', then say, "I")
(Shit, say, "I")
(If you got some real pape', shit, say, "I")
Good in the Bronx (yeah)
Good where you at? Boy, you good with the Josh
Boy, I'm good with the Dracs' (Brr)
Pulled this bitch out my BAPE, you get put in yo' place
Full of dead man, dead man 'Wood, this an eighth
