Yeah, yeah

Dog Shit Militia
[Verse 1: Fordio]
Fordi in the booth and up still, unky servin' kill
Everybody changed lately, I don’t know what's real (
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
Pop a pill, you know the drill, rip another seal
Rather get active in the field ’fore I go phony for a deal
What I sip be ill, lately been juggin' just to live
And I know niggas ain't real, but I can't trip, that's how it is
Know who hit your dog, played it like I had no idea
Perkies got me numb, but that fake love, can still feel
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Amethyst all in my grill, jam the chip, you know the drill
Told lil' cuddy keep it tucked with all them cases open still
My white boy skipped the dabs and wax, he rollin', smokin' pills
I been spendin’ racks on racks on racks on racks, supposed to—
I been spendin’ racks on racks on racks on racks, I'm ’posed to chill
Ran it up already, but I need two M's [?][0:56]
Rojo and morado, we ain't pourin' no Brazil
Don’t get murdered like Bravado, shooter down to show his skill
[Verse 3: Fordio]
What I paid for this rag, could've bought some Denim Tear
You heard Fordi slowed up, I'm confused like, nigga, where?
You broke as hell, need to get repaired, barely make a thousand every year
She like codeine, be my cure, they be fakin', I'm aware
If it's 'bout pape', I'm all ears, only sip green, he Paul Pierce
Ain't have that drank, I'm feelin' weird, I pull some racks, then disappear
I'm known to risk it, had it hard, but now we here (Now we here)
I left that ho right where we met, she insecure
He must not know that season old, he think he trim
Why PAID just wrote some fire tracks, but these ain't lyrics?
