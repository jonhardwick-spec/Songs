[Intro]
(
Marc Boomin, this you?
)
Man, get out your feelings, you crying like that bitch mattered, man
Yeah (
Boomin need extras
)
[Verse]
Rich bastard, bitch talk and I'ma pimp smack her
Mister Tell A Story In The Booth, that boy a big capper
Get up out your feelings, boy, you crying like that bitch mattered
I can hit any self-scan, bitch, these BINs smackers
This a classic, I got Marc Boomin on the beat
Let me open shop, it's gon' start booming in a week
Real MVP, bitch really stupid if she leave
Ain't a ball hog, if I lose, I'm losing with my team
Newest sneakers out of Neiman Marcus, you can hear 'em squeak
2021 seven-seatеr, you can hear it beep
5K for the versе, ten if the lyrics
weak
If it ain't 'bout no money, I'ma act like ain't no ears on me
Huh, I can't hear shit, I'm deaf
12 on the right, finna steer to the left
You can ask my fans, ain't it clear I'm the best?
7.62s look like a spear hit his chest
Let me tell you something, I don't fear nobody
Going 180, I might crash tryna steer the Masi
Running up on tip
? He gon' leave as a spirit probably
Feeling good off these sips, boy, this ain't no beer, it's Wocky
Fire stick on me like I'm finna
Netflix and chill
Could've swore that you was paralyzed, you don't step, for real
Bro want you and him but anybody else a extra kill
Heavy press with the jacks, I ain't never pressed a pill
Unky in the kitchen serving junkies off his dishes
Bitch, leave me 'lone,
if you fuck me, it's a privilege
No cap, if they try and touch me, we'll blitz 'em
Ain't worried 'bout her ex, doggy bummy, rocking biscuits
Ha-ha, ha, with his poor-ass
Unky bring that food to you quicker than some DoorDash
Sounded like a pterodactyl in it when we floored past
Finna block this bitch, she keep calling, with her bored-ass
You bought a gun? Let me guess, you a gangster now
I'm with grave diggers, ride around with Undertaker now
If he up it on your brodie, you can say goodbye
Doggy ain't nod his head once, I'm getting hater vibes
I'm just having fun, I'm just living life
Whole time, just to feel safe, hold a pistol tight
Reach for this chain? Treat him like it, we gon' get him iced
If you owe me pape' and it's that day, I need that shit tonight
I'm just living life, I'm just having fun
'Fore you hop up off that porch, boy, you better grab a gun
Ex bitch got the stupid face, think she mad I won
Would've thought I threw a tactical when I had 'em stunned
Three-five of Runtz sent me to a different solar system
Hunnid something shots, is dawg alive? You was 'posed to hit him
Pray to God every night before bed, I know I'm sinning
On a yacht looking at the sea, catching motion sickness
I ain't saying you a rat, I heard that from your codefendant
Exotic pop, I can't read it, finna pour a four up in it
Granny said, "Tie them big B's, boy, you know you tripping"
Always thought that it was scams but rap was the golden ticket
