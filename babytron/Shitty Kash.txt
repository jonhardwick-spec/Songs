[Intro: Kasher Quon]
(
Marc Boomin, this you?
)
Kasher Quon
Let's go (
Boomin need extras
)
Alright, alright, alright
You feel me?
[Verse 1: Kasher Quon]
Next time you see me, I'm hopping out a Wraith
Got flicked with a pistol and caught a case
I should've did the race
I'm riding in a SRT with the red brakes
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Yeah, she gon' suck it with enthusiasm
Bend it over, beat the box down, she need a coochie casket
Thousand dollar 'Miri jean rocker, ain't no Truey fashion
Only time I punch is on the web, we get tooly active
[Verse 3: TrDee]
I'll get a watch and still show up to the scene late
Starting to think my opps Ray Charles, they ain't seen pape'
Wе been getting to it for a minute, boy, yo team latе
Always on the go, told the dealer I don't need brakes
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Melrose then Rodeo, bitch, I'm shopping out of state
We gon' pop him like a soda, we gon' drop him like a eighth
Steak fiend, everyday I got hibachi on my plate
I ain't had the Glock with me, had to sock him in the face
