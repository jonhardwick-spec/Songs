RJ always tripping so I'm tripping too
Vlone X Runtz, almost hit the moon
Scammed the same ham twice, what a nincompoop
Turn his block to Baghdad, I'ma send some troopsTurn his block to Baghdad, I'll up bazookaTripping in Best Buy, tryna punch computers
Said she need a ride home? Well I got a scooterBitch got good brain, I done found a tutorYou ain't tough, huh, you a keyboard thug
Tap in with the source, you ain't seen a plug
Threw my Apple Watch on and made a Visa run
Busted on yo baby face, come and clean her up
Painted on yo baby face, I'm a MaybellineThis bitch a whole Grim Reaper, I can't believeEach and every place I go, I'ma take three
Wake up and chase chicken like that nigga PeterTold that bitch keep it pushing like a wheelchairHow the hell you up and yo mama still on welfare?
