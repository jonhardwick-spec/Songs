[Chorus: Rich Ash]
I'm at the top with the gang, it’s only us
You niggas finally got some pape', it took long enough
Paid the plug in Bitcoin, he loaded up
I ain't like the watch plain, now the Rollie bust (
Good lookin’, Dnell
)
[Verse 1: Rich Ash]
Oh, I thought a snitch-ass nigga, forgot he said somethin' (You pussy)
Made the easiest money my life this summer
He know his bitch fuckin', he gon' bust her head open
But she say this nigga broke and he don't spend no bands on her
Just put the head on me, I don't feel like hittin'
A nigga reach for my chain, he don't feel like living (On God, nigga)
I’m in that big body and the windows tinted (Elade)
I got played once, I don’t get no feelings
You trick on bitches, and they don't even let you hit (Ham)
Fresh as hell with a sixty-thousand-dollar ’kit (VS)
Before I be a nigga like you, I'll quit
Wealthy tee on, bitches like Ash rich (It's Rich)
Fuck a past tense, bitch, I'm up currently (Right now)
It’s money on the floor, I'ma come urgently (Right now)
Right now it ain't a nigga out workin' me (Right now)
An opp got dropped, ain't no point in surgery

I'm at the top with the gang, it's only us
You niggas finally got some pape', it took long enough (
Yeah

Paid the plug in Bitcoin, he loaded up (

I'm at the top with the gang, it's only us (Gang)
You niggas finally got some pape', it took long enough
Paid the plug in Bitcoin, he loaded up
I ain't like the watch plain, now the Rollie bust (
