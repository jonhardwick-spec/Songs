Ayo Vin, that shit hard

[Verse 1: ShooterGang Kony]
South truth, bitch, I keep it
I been on the road fightin' demons, parking lot bleedin'
Hit him in his throat, that's what you call gettin' even
Niggas only listen to the kid when they need it
On any given Sunday, I'm Willie Beamen
I'll tag a nigga if he slide, Derek Jeter
I'll break a bitch, make her pay the whole meter
Suckers, all they rap about is weed, it get deeper
Let's talk about your dead homies, too much bread on me (Ayy, ayy)
Still blow my pole while the feds on me
I shoot guns, I'm a vet, you sold dope
Let this fully get to go, he gon' blow with no hope
I got camo on the coat Bathing
Say I'm comin' home, I leave a bitch waitin'
Might've took her from her man, but I ain't bitch savin'
Sayin' I can't rap or don't shoot, that's a shit statement
Poppin' out stick hangin'
I don't need one maintenance, my life fixed
If I sift, I got chicken, I could pour the whole brick
Lil Greg, that's my main mans, he can't miss
If he did, shit, I must already hit him in this bitch
Dressed in all red, I feel like John Marston
Caught a wallflower at the mall, now he a target
You ain't had a haircut in weeks, you look starvin'
I'll put a nigga on a tape with his artist
