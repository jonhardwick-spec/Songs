[Verse 1: Fordio]
All these lame ass niggas, they be wannabees
She say she don't wanna leave
Pour a four [?] taking me
Shit [?] ain't no fake in me
Yeah I [?] like Jimmy Chew, but I'm in Versace T
I don't trip on shit you do, 40 just might let you leave
30 [?] flee the scene
[?] green bean
Pop really got some [?] cream
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
This bitch started white peach, I blackened my fanta
Iced up, grabbing gifts, acting like I'm Santa
Roll a slab wood for breakfast, apples and banannas
Lennox parking lot, I'm in Atlanta, scratching in a phantom
Doggy telling stories, like he report for the news
Swear to god if you ain't gang, then abort from the room
We just dropped a twelve of Wok, gon' be snoring til noon
Said he see me running, shit, he did more than some shrooms
[Verse 3: Fordio]
Shit, mama asking where I be, shit, I'm in [?]
You might catch me nodding off, the highest in the room
Yeah, I've been thinking 'bout [?] more than a few
Then hit his bitch out the park, 40 ain't no [?]
Shit, [?] bark, you might hear a roof
[?] let me pour this duce
[?] ain't dead, 'cause we living proof
If I cut her off the roster, she was moving loose
