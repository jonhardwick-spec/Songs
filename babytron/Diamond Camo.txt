[Intro]
(
It's Hokatiwi
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Walked in the rain, now I'm finna walk in Golden Sun
Think the lil' bitch let me fuck 'cause I'm the chosen one
Bitch called me broke, well, I guess that she smokin' drugs
God bust a scam, I'll fuck around and choke a nun
Call of Duty
zombie, got this bitch poppin' Percs
I ain't know if he died, so I popped a hearse
You ain't got an iPad, an Apple Watch'll work
Feel like T. Max, see an opp and let the rocket work
[Verse 2: Teejayx6]
Check in my pocket like it just passed the first
Fucked this bitch 'fore she left, now she missing work
When a jugg don't send, swear it be the worst
Shot his ass in the leg, but it could be worse
How you mad at me 'cause you took a loss?
She had clothes on, but I made her take 'em off
Nigga went to get a job, why you take that route?
Seen a nigga like
Call of Duty
and took him out
[Verse 3: 10kkev]
I'm out of town workin' while you workin' at a drive-thru
Run off on me and I'ma find somewhere to hide you
Fuck around and leave a corpse in the lake
Scammed a nigga from the UK and I said, "Thank you, mate"
She left with me after the show 'cause she got perky tits
You slid in her DM, I slid on her shift
Use every piece in the BIN and cross it off my list
I'ma go to your grave site when I gotta piss
