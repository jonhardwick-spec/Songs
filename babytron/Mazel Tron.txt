[Intro: BabyTron &
BLP KOSHER
]
Ayy, KOSHER, you know how to play tennis?
I don't know how to play, but we can go back to back
Alright, it’s on
ShittyBoyz, Dog Shit Militia
Water, they let the dreidel in
They let me fly to Cali, Tron, where you at?
Shit, I'm pullin' up to the court right now
Long live $cams
Water, ayy
[Chorus: BLP KOSHER &
BabyTron
]
They say I’m the GOAT, new drip, where's the lamb sauce?
Flyer than a birdie, Desert Eagle in my Trackhawk
I ain't Irish, but my money doublin', grab a shamrock
I ain't trickin' with you bitches, pockets came with padlocks
They thought that I was fantasizing, showed 'em that I can pop
Grew my hair down to my shoulders, fan thought I was Matt Ox
Jump a fence and get my lick back like this The Sandlot
Tell them boys to quit the lying, living life on caps lock
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Florida to the Mitten, SBDSM X BLP
You a burger with some ham minus cheese, you a BLT
Tables, ladders, chairs, it get extreme, we creep like TLC
You gon' catch some legal bullets, boy, I got a CLPOops, I mean CPL
,
my driver got a CDL
Why this bitch be preachin’ like she real, but got a BBL?
If I ever fell off, it was on a trampoline
How I walk out with it on, you would’ve thought it's fashion week
Off Runtz, defying gravity, the Wraith look like a galaxy
My shooter throw his hoodie on and score, Carmelo Anthony
Was in school, I had that bag on me with more pape’ than the faculty
Boy, you grown without a strategy, that's really just a tragedy
Rolled a seven in the Jungo leaf, that's max capacity
They left me in the jungle in the rain, ain't have a canopy
Jugg Messiah,
I’m your majesty or that shit blasphemy
And free the legend 80s, I can't lie, look up "Veracity"
