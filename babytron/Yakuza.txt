[Verse 1: Fordio]
Should I mix the 'Pane with the Quag'? Been contemplatin'
If it's drank or the shippin', that's the only time I'm waitin'
I'm impatient, I just add the VPN so they can't trace it
Tryna find a way to profit, I'm not with the conversation
Exotic from Rozay, it's hittin' too damn hard, I think he laced it
I peep you be hesitatin', please pass me my medication
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
You would think that I was Jason
Hop up out his bushes, chase him
Roll my problems up and face 'em
Keep the blicky, heard they hate him
Dirty bitches, man, who raised 'em?
Rats, snitches, why they make 'em?
Why my roster trippin' like I won't turn around and replace 'еm?
In the pen', he got a shank, a monkеy probably would've Drac'd 'em
Any given night, might pop out with a fifty, Jayson Tatum
[Verse 3: J1Hunnit]
All this dog shit, I need Charmin
I like my cup red, election
Roll his face on chocolate, Nestlé
Rockstar lifestyle, Elvis Presley
Perc' look like the script, he pressed him
One-of-one jeans full of Jacksons, Jessie
Screwed-up pint, my cup from Texas
I kick shit like Lionel Messi
Rap shit just a lil' occupation
Dope dealin' was my main profession
Wool-knit pulled down over my eyes
Supreme beanie on, lookin' like a Mexican
