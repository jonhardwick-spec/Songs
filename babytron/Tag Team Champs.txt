[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Ooh shit, that's a Danny G beat
)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, okay (
It's BlueStrip, baby
)
Bitch, yeah
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Gramz walked in, White Gushers, fifty for a eighth
Big drum hanging out the chop, it's sixty in the K
Old Tron was road running, putting giffies in a safe
All blues in my skinnies, it's a Nipsey type of day
[Verse 2: KrispyLife Kidd]
Unorthodox, I just shoot the K any type of way
CPL shooters, go ahead and give yo life away
Clear bottom on the Triple S's, I'm on ice today
Catch a body in a whip and then go and change the license plate
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
Catch a body in a Demon then we to the chop shop
Busting in this bitch mouth like soda and some Pop Rocks
So much smoke in thе droptop, it's a hot box
Bought my shooter seven wеapons, all he know is drop opps
[Verse 4: KrispyLife Kidd]
Hit dawg tee up close, turnt it to a crop top
One day I seen my uncle cook a brick in a crock-pot
You dropped a tape and I ain't hear, my nigga, you is not hot
Beat my granny boyfriend ass like, "Bro, you is not pops"
