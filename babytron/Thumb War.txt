[Intro]
(Enrgy made this one)
Ayy, huh, ayy
[Verse]
You know we in the hood, you see bandos and teddy bears
Walk into the spot with shiesty on, it's full of fetty air
I don't do the sugarcoatin', sick of hoes, I'm booger blowin'
Know we in the hood, it's 3 AM and you see hookers strollin'
Legs wrapped in Who Decides War, I came from PRP
If she DTF, I get the neck, then I say BRB
Hoggin' up the road in TRXes, I'm with TrDee
Pullin' paper off the route, you probably think I'm PRE
One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb warUSDs, Euros, Yen, IDM, I up more
Five, six, seven, eight, I guarantee we up score
Rude on a whore, I tell her talk less and suck more
Hundreds in the safe, dubs and tens in the junk drawer
Huh, ahh
If it's beef, we spinnin' like taquitos
If a pint of blood on the floor, I turn mosquito
Me and cuddy powered up, might morph into Vegito
Broke the bank off takin' gambles, ain't see a casino
Brodie headed to the 10, thinkin' Nashville or Knoxville
Chillin' with the geek squad, they crack seals and pop pills
If they elect me President, gon' get the opps killed
If it's money 'round, prescribe me Ritalin, I cannot chill
Two-hand jammin', Disco' off the Amex
Plug stallin', hit the dispo, then I fake stress
We ain't trippin', lil' ho, you can call your bros
We gon' spin around and do two hundred like the auto show
Fooly, he ain't ready for no 30s, he a 10 head
When I wrap the Richard Millie 'round, might turn to Ben 10
High as hell thinkin' what's what, when's when?
Where's where, who's who? I'm on M-10
Another twenty-four, another road to run
If I ain't lightin' up a looseleaf, I'm rollin' one
Two thousand elbows in, I done smoked a ton
Procedure orthopedic, pulled up and poked her gums
You would miss an open dunk
Nah, just Runtz, but you probably think we smoked a skunk
Think I'm underneath enchantment, I can't give the potion up
Noddin' off a four, the money counter be done woke me up
Focused off the shrooms, hear the game yellin', "Soak me up"
Rollin' out the zip, hear the 'bow yellin', "Smoke me up"
Stiff arms, juke moves, you can't hold me up
Bitch wanna hold somethin', I tell a slut, "Hold these nuts"
