[Chorus]
I mean, slow motion beats no motion
I be showboatin', treat 'em so bogus
Finna roll my dope up and pour potion
Multicolor ice up on my chest, might catch me snow-coning
I mean, slow motion beats no motion
I be showboatin', treat 'em so bogus
Finna roll my dope up and pour potion
Multicolor ice up on my chest, might catch me snow-coning
[Verse 1]
I took a leap of faith and came out with big boy rewards
Have 'em dump it on you, slime you out, Kids Choice Awards
Life's short, before you go, gotta enjoy it first
Lookin' for your safe, like Call of Duty, we destroy and search
Wouldn't tell 'em nothin', save it for the birds, that boy a chirp
Configuring my Double R, gon' play the Royce berserk
Why you talking me to death? I'm all kinds of annoyed
Jack tapped, show brodie a hundred, we Skypin' off 'Droids
Militia ties, you can't back down when it's time to deploy
Application time, it's over, we tried to employ
Pourin' out the baby bottle, we slidin' with toys
Sick the plug hit you with silence, we buyin' the noise
I'ma take the summer, ball it up, and put it in my pocket
It's gon' cost about a fifty-one to book us and deposit
Used to push me to the bottom, now I'm lookin' like the topic
Usually I don't show my hand, the way he shook it, gotta watch him
How you gon' ball with the legends when your level intermediate?
Hop in mode and I get mean if I catch you up on the median
Every load I pick up double X, don't do no mediums
All these years of cookin' and they still ain't found ingredients
