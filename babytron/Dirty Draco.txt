[Chorus: BabyTron]
Brodie got a dirty Draco, he just took a hit (Brrt)
Shit, I got a dirty Faygo, I just took a sip (Ah)
Brodie got a dirty Draco, he just took a hit (Brrt)
Shit, I got a dirty Faygo, I just took a sip (Ah)
[Verse 1: Babytron]
You can't take a thing
You gon' get iced like one of 'em tryna take a chain
Think he fly, it's temporary like a paper plane
Takin' risks day to day, I be state to state
Shit, I can't take a break
Shit, how I'm thinkin', need a hundred M's now
Shit, how I'm thinkin', need a hundred M's, yeah
Hop up in that super Charger, finna bend blocks
Tool efficient, boy, hittin' ten of ten shots
Shit
It is what it is, it ain't what it was
I ain't used to have a dollar, now my pape' weigh a ton
I'm peepin' anacondas, if I see you snake, then you done
Team stat, check the roster, don't play, wе the ones
Hypebеast tendencies, walk in the crib, it's Bape on the rugs
Pourin' drank and rollin' eighths, I'm facin' all the drugs (Ah)
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Brodie got a dirty draco, he just took a hit (Brrt)
Shit, I got a dirty Faygo, I just took a sip (Ah)
Brodie got a dirty draco, he just took a hit (Brrt)
Shit, I got a dirty Faygo, I just took a sip (Ah)
