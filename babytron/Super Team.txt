[Intro: BabyTron]
(
Darko in that bitch crazy
)
Man, they done put the super team together
Let me talk to 'em
Ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
You can keep that lil' bitch, boy, the head was awful (Awful)
201 so fresh, I'm a vet in Target (Woo)
Said that I'm broke, bitch, beg your pardon (What?)
Chop got a sensor on it, I'm detectin' targets (Rrah)
Doin' tricks in that pussy, feelin' extra gnarly (Ayy, ayy)
Lookin' like a treasure map with these X's on me (Off-White)
They say I'm chose, but I don't feel the pressure on me (I don't)
I only caught you with chicken when you left the Coney (Bitch)
Real Madrid with the kicks, they all foreign (Foreign)
Put up stats with the punches, they all scorin' (Scorin')
Fake ID, doin' fraud, I'm Paul Morgan (Hi)
R.I.P. to the opps, they all soarin' (Yeah)
All-star team on the track, that's extra thrust (Heavy thrust)
Anorexic jeans, but I still got a weapon tucked
You could be a whole Kappa and couldn't step with us (You can't)
Triple S's weigh more than Kev, had to step it up (Damn)
[Verse 2: 10kKev]
Found the Red Octobers, made a sale for ten thousand
I don't window shop, I plan to purchase if I'm browsin'
You hit the mall just to look, I'm grabbin' this and that
He was talkin' crazy, I swung on him, made him kiss a bat
It's hard to add up the 'fit 'cause all the items rare
These Chanels ain't hit the US, you won't find 'em there
You ain't hittin' Wallys how you say, I won't find you there
Made blood sisters fuck each other, it was a truth-or-dare
