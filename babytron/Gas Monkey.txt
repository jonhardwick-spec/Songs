[Verse 1: Nuk]
I'm out here in Aziz, finna toast the drank
I know some hoes that love the coke more than Franklin Saint
If you ever get word from me, it can't be can't
'Cause I do more than these niggas on a day-to-day
Lost two hundred twenty cash, made me kind of patient
I be bringin' bitches home, they lined around the bases
I can see the snake in niggas through they smilin' faces
Sorry I got sidetracked, we fought a lot of cases
Sorry I got sidetracked, we tapped a lot of heads
Had to body-bag the 'bows 'cause it's a lot of dead
I'm puttin' too much dick in her, I think it locked her legs
They heard they bringin' Killa home, I think he boxed the feds
Put the silly bitches down, do a spin around
We be choppin' up the beef, we do it Philly style
After I hit her with this dick, she gotta wheel around
Hit a BBL bitch and then I fill her out
[Chorus: Nuk &
BabyTron
]
I can kick a bitch to the side if her ass funky
I be puttin' niggas in a ride, I'm like Gas Monkey
You ain't spent your last and had to sit down 'til the bag comin'
I just hit the dope with a five, I put a mask on it
I be sendin' smoke to the air, I'm still around for it
My girl be puttin' niggas on they face, she a tomboy
In other words, what I'm tryna say, she be around boy
He be tender over all his hoes, he a wild boy (
Ayy
