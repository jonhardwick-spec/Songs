(
Stop flexin' your muscles, Jordan
)
Get the fuck out the way
(
Damn, JakeSand
)
Move
'Fore I smush you, mush you, all that
[Chorus]
When we walkin', do the mushin'
When we walkin', do the smushin'
You can't shove us, you can't bump us, we the ones who do the pushin'
Belt to ass, even when I'm rockin' joggy, do the whoopin'
Unky in the mountains, takin' huskies with him, Cuba Gooding
When we walkin', do the mushin'
When we walkin', do the smushin'
You can't shove us, you can't bump us, we the ones who do the pushin'
Belt to ass, even whеn I'm rockin' joggy, do the whoopin'
Unky in the mountains, takin' huskies with him, Cuba Gooding
[Verse]
Oh, you don't know mе? Just go check on Wikipedia
You couldn't even get a pass if you came with the media
Cuddy in the kitchen, whippin' babies, disobedient
Slimy, grimy, watch me pop a V, could get so devious
It look like fashion week
What I'm wearin' right now damn near cost a half a ki'
You better see a preacher 'fore them creatures see you first
You can't out-P me, third eye open, I can see you lurk
They don't even know my worth, just declined another offer
They was tryna ride the wave, next summer, catch 'em underwater
My stuffer ridin' with a white tee, not no Summer Walker
Let a bitch use her lips droppin' los, we pull up, cut 'em off her
