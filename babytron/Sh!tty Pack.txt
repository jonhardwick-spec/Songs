[Intro: StanWill]
Ooh, shit, what the fuck, Daniel?
Wouldn't waste a bullet on his ass
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
[Verse 1: StanWill]
Wouldn't waste a bullet on his ass, I'ma beat him with the Drac'
This ain't no fat joke, but Packman'll eat 'em for the pape'
Pull up tryna scrap, bet you won't see another day
I just caught an opp in Oakland, finna sink him in the Bay
Ten racks on this Hutch charm make my neck shiver
Unky on the stove, pot scrapin', he a 'Rex whipper
Life about playin' your hand, not who deck bigger
They'll backstab you, watch your dawgs like a pet sitter
Hoes, they'll fold on you, hoes, they'll switch
I shot fifty in a second, boy, this pole got the switch
Think thе 'Wood bench pressin', boy, it's strong than a bitch
Bro'll shred your wholе gang, he like Mone with the blick, huh
[Verse 2: TrDee]
If you not the gang, don't approach me like you know me
'Cause I got the blicky and might shoot it just like Kobe
Wrist been lookin' naked, I might just go get a Rollie
Really came from nothin', hold my chain up like a trophy
Really stayed down until the whole team came up
Only one rule, stay solid, never change up
No, I cannot listen to your raps 'cause it's made up
No, I did not come to kick it with you, give that brain up
Pockets look like Packman, I be workin' like Rihanna
Let me know it's smoke, we turn your spot into a fuckin' sauna
Oh, let me guess, you can dress because you got designer?
Sick you 'came R. Kelly on 'em, tryna fuck a minor
