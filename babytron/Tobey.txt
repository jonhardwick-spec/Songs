[Intro: BabyTron &
Big Sean
]
Shit, fuck, shit
Boy
, huh
[Chorus: BabyTron]
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
No español, I'm allergic to rojo and legally blind, all I'm seein' is "go"
D to the A, there and back, if we ride with the Drac', can't smoke from the T to the O
Upped than a bitch, you can keep what you owe
Granny told me, "Boy, you reap what you sow"
Do the most, we over-even the score
Said he on the run, glued his feet to the floor
Up in my Tesla, I'm rollin' up 'Ishers, I stopped at Valero, think I should quit smokin'
Life is a gamble and I'm playin' slots, pull it down, close my eyes and I pray I win tokens
All Wock', no pop, how we drop, you can come and take a baby sip, still taste that it's potent
One of one, sittin' 'round the stars, double R, finna race, yeah, the Wraith like a spaceship, it's floatin'
All this drip, think I am below sea level
Cut your own wrist off with that weak bezel
Ride around with the Iron Giant, make 'em eat metal
Watch unc' break a rock down to three pebblesBam-bam, down three, hit the grand slam
Four pockets full, fully switched, go wham-wham
Pants cramp, pull it down, I'm countin' 'til my hands cramp
Wrote "DSM" on the beach, now the sand stamped
