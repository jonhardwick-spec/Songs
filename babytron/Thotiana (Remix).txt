[Verse]
The only thing you good for is playing roles, Kevin Spacey
Bitch got some super brain, she tryna educate me
Thought he got a ziparooni, it was seven eighties
Walking to the ring with your bitch, I'm finna Devin Haney
Both mine's froze, you got bare wrists
You might get a rare reward if you take some rare risk
Overdid the Quag', I'm stuck like a bear brick
Dude out here smooching bitches that I wouldn't dare kiss
You hear me barking, it's the D$M
Put a button on the Glock then put an opp on CNN
RIP Ben Frank, I really miss my BFF
Whole family got sauce like we TSF
The way we living, you probably think we BMF
Red bean, blue bean, shitty in the EMS
How the fuck I'm feeling noon yet? It ain't even PM yet
Hey, hey, hey
You ain't a demon neph, sipping all that green, I bet you turn into a chia pet
DJ Tron, shit, we the best
