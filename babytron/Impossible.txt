[Intro: BabyTron]
Should I do the Goose or the Moose Knuckle? (
RJ always tripping, man
)
(

)
I just made a
I just walked in the, this that new hustle
Ayy, ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Should I do the Goose or the Moose Knuckle?
Just walked out of, that's that new hustle
I been punching all day, need some new knuckles
And I'm playing with them pieces, I don't do puzzles
[Verse 2: StanWill]
Nike tech, getting technical
I'm on all smoke 'cause the chop got testicles
Keep yo heart, bitch, I just want the rest of you
Healthy-ass Glock turn a opp to a vegetable
[Verse 3: TrDee]
Picked up a fuck and threw that bitch in the lake
On the road getting head, got me smashing on the brakes
I don't care about her, bitch, no, we cannot date
But I got this bougie bitch, she don't eat off paper plates
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Rob me? Tom Cruise, that's impossible
Pink Yeezy 500s, feel like Majin Buu
Euro stepping with the blick, I don't stop and shoot
I ain't had shit, now I got a whole lot to lose
