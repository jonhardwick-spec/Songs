[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Alright, huh
Hoes call me Naw Man, they never heard me say yes
I'll get you stepped on for the low like it's Payless
Huh, I don't really say shit unless it's "Say less"
Fuck these hoes lil bro, you should save stress
Zero miles on it, rims shinin' and the paint wet
Same team, several rings I done came Steph
Go and hit a hat, tap a top, pass the aim test
We ain't worried 'bout you, you ain't the main threat
Bih- bitch, bag back with that flame brеath
Am I up a milli yet? Like shit, is rain wet?
Evеrybody play it tough until it's time to face death
BIN Reaper, well known on Big Beaver
I can fill a card up, I can hit a chip reader
Let me stop talkin' bout the old me, I sell features
Yeah I been in my bag, but don't you see I fell deeper?
Tss... It's one thought: Get some dollas
Quag' or Wocky, we'll grab some Pai before we sip some vodka
That's a no-no, where yo' hoe go?
This life shit up and down like a yo-yo
Shout out to your main one, she a throat goat
Chop the face, 41, this hoe a rolla
ARP with the kick, call it NOJO
