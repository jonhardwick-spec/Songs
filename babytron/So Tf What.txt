Countin' through a thousand Ben Franks, that's just the usual
This shit beautiful, now I got some blueish cuticles
Got her hittin' notes, I turned the porno to a musical

[Verse 2: Certified Trapper]
You down bad to your last, so the fuck what?
Bitch said she need her hair done, so the fuck what?
Bitch said she need her nails done, so the fuck what?
Bitch said she need her bills paid, grow the fuck up
You down bad to your last, so the fuck what?
Bitch said she need her hair done, so the fuck what?
Bitch said she need her nails done, so the fuck what?
Bitch said she need her bills paid, grow the fuck up
[Verse 3: BabyTron]
I lost track how many miles, we just tore the road up
If I pop this RP, I be done tore your ho up
If I bring a CVV, I be done tore the store up
If I let the fully off, I be done tore his 'fro up
