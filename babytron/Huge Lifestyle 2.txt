[Intro: BabyTron]
Hey
Lifestyle (
Damn, Machu, why you had to do 'em like that?
)
[Verse 1: BabyTron &
GTP Daidoe
]
Lifestyle used to be huge, now this shit colossal
Hellkitties, Trackhawks, we only riding whips with throttle
Rap star, what you think? I'm only hitting models
Explosive tips up in the clip but I'll switch this bitch to hollows
Apricot Gelato but the Backwood banana flavor
V cut, four of Wockiana, that's an activator
Bitch tryna add the drip up? Gon' need a calculator
Funny actor showing love now, while y'all fans are haters
EDD and SBA gone, now your pockets tapped
All that lying in the booth, pull up on him, pop his cap
Punch God, got more jabs on me than a boxing match
Black Amiri jeans, black Goose with the Glock to match (
Yeah
)
[Verse 2: GTP Daidoe &
BabyTron
]
I be out the way but in the way like a side nigga
Don't post yo gun if you ain't gon' come outside with it
Put a potato on the muzzlе, tryna fry niggas
Mama told me, "Put that cup down," but I'ma die sipping (Yeah)
Bitch poppеd a RP, now she on demon time
We fucking in the Scat Pack with the seats reclined
If the bitch broke with no pape', she ain't one of mine
I just dropped a pint in the pop, we ain't pouring lines (Yeah)
Six times four, shit you can't afford
Shirt say BAPE, Bathing Ape, ain't get it from the store
Crackers got my brother in the jam, turn him to a s'more (
Huh
)
