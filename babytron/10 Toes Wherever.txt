[Intro]I was up working(Ayo, Mark A)
[Verse]
I was up working, you was probably sleep procrastinating
They done turned me up with the hate, now I'm activated
Face card really scorching, I ain't just acting famous
I was even balling in the beater, feel like Calvin Cambridge
Doggy song had more cap than a graduation
Prezis on his head, get him blew like a stack of Franklins
Thinking he a demon? Fuck around and send his ass to Satan
Crib big as hell, even the yard in the back is spacious
I be blowing za, you smoke Reggie Miller
Dog Shit Militia, ShittyBoyz, we some heavy shitters
Nails, bundle, and the purse, I ain't petty with her
One eye open in the kitchen, bro a Fetty whipper
This ain't 1738, this some Wockhardt
Shooter got like thirty-some badges, this is not park
What I drop last? Shit, go and check the top charts
Knock him out that new Chrome hoodie, chop' stop hearts
Jack Man, catching bricks like I'm Jonas Valančiūnas
In that fast thang, off a dirty soda acting stupid
My mans backdoor me, hope that I ain't have to do it
Was an evil kid, young Tron was a bad influence
Nobody does it better, shit, dog, I feel like Snoop
Four figure cup, better not let me spill my juice
Mister Big Shot, I get like when Billups shoot
Twenty deep in BAPE hoodies, I'll let them 'rillas loose
Blowing bands in my Stone Island, someone take a pic
Buffs looking like alfredo on my steak and shrimp
Out in Cali, flying down Rodeo in the latest shit
Gotta mow the grass if I see the snake in him
Yeah, you got on Mike Amiris but it ain't no pape' in them
They ain't one of us, gang, gang, we can't hang with them
Diamond in the rough, now I'm in the booth making gems
They in arm's reach, I ain't even really chasing M's
Doggy wanted za, gave his ass shaking and hemp
Smoking Gary Payton, this month I done made a kemp
Waiting till he leave the crib, hitman done made a tent
Why you flashing on the 'Gram but out here late on rent?
Why you in the club feeling good? You finna get evicted
Call of Duty shit, backpack, six pistols in it
Baby Drac', it got some missiles in it
Tornado mode in the Demon, bitch, I'm spinning in it
Talkin' big money but your bank ain't got a nickel in it
In that widebody, freewaying, tryna wiggle in it
Talking 'bout a plug? You the monkey in the middle with it
Habibi up that paintbrush, he finna scribble with it
Riding 'round in that droptop with no worries
Clip hold Curry
Throw it out the window if they flick us 'cause the pole dirty
Zaza after zaza, vision so blurry
Ten toes wherever, give a fuck what's going on
Thousand dollar coat, I just bought it, finna throw it on
Fake-ass kit that you wearing? Boy, you know you wrong
Feeling cocky, buffs on my face and I'm blowing strong
