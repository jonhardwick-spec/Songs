[Intro]
Two Ls then a dollar sign, you know what it is, long live seven-two
(Bitch)
(
You're not making this easy, Kyle
)
Hey, ayy
Hey, ayy
Hey, ayy
[Verse]
Wake up, then get right to it (Hey, ayy)
Yeah, my lil' bitch a dime, five deuces
(Hey, ayy)
Dark as hell, you would think my Sprite ruined
(Hey, ayy)
We just touched down in L.A. just like Bruins (Hey, ayy)
Got a fifty in the clip, I'm times two of 'em
(Hey, hey)
Throwin' bowls, drop 'em off, yeah, I looted 'em (Hey, ayy)
Spark a 'Wood and it enlightened me likе Buddha-nem
Asked lil' brodie, "Why all thе guns?" He say he like shootin' 'em (Hey, ayy)
Hit the road, time to travel, let me fuel up (Hey)
Dual wield totin', sippin' out of dual cups
(Hey)
You might do it to the 'Gram, but you can't fool us
You don't even know the game, the type to look the rules up (Hey)
Sleeve Francis, I'm the franchise
Ironic that my cup so muddy, score a landslide
Forty on my waist, but I ain't fat, that ain't my pants size
Blow 'em like a land mine
It don't take shit for bro to do it, just a hand sign
Dawg don't pop up, he must be shadowbanned in his hood
Used to go to school with pape', I had a band just because
Raised in the wilderness, I wonder what've happened if I never landed with the wolves
I ain't never hand to hand with scammin', hammin' with the juug
I ain't had a zero in a while, stack it to the sky
Soda black as hell, you touch it, it's gon' match up with your eye
If I really want you gone, I bet they whack you by tonight
Amiris with the bones, I'll blow like a wall breaker
If I pop a ten, I bet she treat it like a jawbreaker
If it ain't no profit on the floor then we can talk later
Give it all I got for four quarters, I'm a ball player
Need to give that truck away, you drivin' Tow Mater
Can you put your rap career on the coat hanger?
All you do is comment weird shit, you a pro hater
And the whole damn time, you a no-namer
It's fucked up, when you up, they think you owe favors
On the wild West, solo dolo, I'm a lone ranger
Stop playin', get the drop easy from the locaters
You can't hide forever
Bro slide then I slide, we gon' ride together
Windows down in the trenches, I drive wherever
Six thousand on some Marni, all I did was buy a sweater
Threw it on they lie when they say you only fly with feathers
Why the fuck do you think you can fuck with me?
Khris Middleton, you middle man, keep it a buck with me
Ain't no munch in me, ain't no chump in me
Used to be in school like, "Oh, that's your lunch? Give me"
Is you dumb, silly? You ain't touch Jimmy
Y'all some monkeys in a barrel, told my brothers, "Come with me"
Shit, it's pre-game, wait 'til the clock start
Twenty-four, I just poured three eighths of Wockhardt
