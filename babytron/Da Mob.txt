[Intro]
(
Is that a Danny G beat? Yeah, turn it up
)
[Verse 1: TrDee]
Cruising on the East with the gang and a bad bitch
And she getting money, she ain't nothing like my last bitch
I'ma blame Megan, got her thinking she a savage
Way before Corona, ShittyBoyz was living lavish
Bitch, I'm with the gang, we do the stepping, ain't no horsing us
She can act bougie but I bet you that my niggas fucked
[?] on my nigga Stan, keep the weapon tucked
Competition? Nah, know they niggas cannot fuck with us
You don't shoot shit, you the 12th man
Bad bitch, hit her with the Gucci, I'm the Belt Man
Catch a package early, I was dapping up the mailman
Baby wanna fuck, why you got a man then?
[Verse 2: BabyTron]
Feel like [?] told his ass don't worry about it
Hunnid rounder on the AR, fuck up thirty houses
August been a motherfucker, I done blew like thirty thousand
Granny asking what that beep is, I think she heard me counting
I might beat yo ass, shoot yo ass, or I might do both
I can call Hutch in one click, you can't, kudos
Always say I'm done scamming then I do like two more
Feel like young Manu, just hit Chase for a 2-0
Me and Mike Amiri beefing, his jeans too skinny
When I say it's one Tron in me, it ain't two Jimmys
Let me see two rats, the AR, it got two Mickeys
Too dizzy, boy, these turn arounds, they got my crew litty
