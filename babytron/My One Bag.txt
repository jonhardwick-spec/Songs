[Intro]
(
Damn, Tye, you made this bitch too?
)
(
The fuck got into you?
) Man
I'm lookin' for a whatchama—
Whatchamacallit
Uzi, Uzi, yeah, alright
Bitch, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
[Verse]
You ever tapped a hat and watched his eyes roll back?
Hatin'-ass opps, hope they lines go flat
My iPhone and watch, boy, the times don't match
Fakin' like a robber, boy, you wouldn't take a shower
It's gon' take me days to thumb it, guess I'm finna play the counter
Magic 8 ball, she got the answer, I'ma shake it out her
And if that face A1, I might just stay an hour
Catch him out and turn his foreign into a haunted hayride
If they catch us on the Interstate, thеy'll call the canines
When it comеs to practice, I'm like, "Fuck it", ball like AI
Since he actin' like an ape, I'm knockin' off his Bape sign
I don't talk through the grapevine
V.I.P, fuck a line, cut the wait time
A one-seven super pay me, this a trey five
Let it ring in 'Bachi wind, call that FaceTime
Had your bitch runnin' like the coach said, "Baseline"
Thoughts about the past, wishin' that I could erase mines
Dinner date, bad bitch, you see steak, wine
You can't relate, boy, your plate just a shake, fries?
First string, she done made it to my fave five
Overdid the tweak twos, now my brain fried
When it's beef, boy, you can't run, can't hide?
Finna do the Wockhardt off the Grape Fize
One thing about the grind, boy, it takes time
I don't trip, I just peep out the fake vibes
One thing that I pray is the snakes die
Eyes lower than a fuck, but I stay high
If I ain't slip into the Crocs, it's the
Yae
slides
Why you playin' both tryna make it to the safe side?
Boy, I can't trust you
You ain't got nothin' goin' for you, girl, I can't fuck you
If they first name ain't God, then they can't judge you
When you first option for your team, shit, they can't sub you
When you makin' that shit happen, boy, they can't rush you
Gotta use your head, you out your shit thinkin' they can't touch you
Gotta even watch your back when they say, "Love you"
