[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy, ayy
Oh shit, Lee
You a fool for this one
ShittyBoyz
[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Fuck geometry, I get it in from all angles
Playing hide-and-seek from these demons in my Palm Angels
AR with the monkey nuts, watch the balls dangle
Shao Kahn, up the soul snatcher and do dawg fatal
[Verse 2: TrDee]
Bro on the West, told him pull up on the East
He think this a scam, this ain't that, we can meet
Can't take her to the crib so I punched us a suite
You still on a porch, I been running in the street
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Chopsticks like the China Palace, I ain't Master Roshi
Lionel Messi kick on a stick, I'll zap a goalie
Heart cold, Moncler be the jacket on me
You gon' kill me? Boy, we know that that's caparoni
[Verse 4: BabyTron]
This the new wave, boy, don't crash yo boat
Think my knee caps broke, I can't stand you hoes
Out of town, grabbing jacks till I can't no more
Punch fell out my Nike tech, almost cracked the floor
