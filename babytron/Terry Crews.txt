[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Eighty dollars what I need for a durantula
Heard he at the BNB, we pull up, shoot the mansion up
The chop got more legs on that bitch than a tarantula
If I don't got that bitch on me, I'ma knuckle sandwich something
Huh, jamming chips till they jam me up
Stand out in the room and I ain't even standing up
Goose parka big as fuck, got a gadget tucked
RIP Cartier Cash, bitch, you can add me up
[Verse 2: TrDee]
I don't know nobody with no money, just to keep it real
Opposition said they getting to it? They is not for real
Heard y'all niggas put him on a shelf, I cannot sign a deal
Yeah, I'm kinda skinny but pockets get a lot of meals
Give me ten minutes, I'ma have her like she Winnie Pooh
She gon' flock to me like a bird, told that bitch to shoo
[Verse 3: StanWill]
Knowing she belong to the streets, bitch, I'm hip to you
I ain't into beef, I could show you what the chicken do
Running 'round, pockets half my weight
Lil'-ass money, boy, you couldn't even cash my steak
Got about twenty jacks off, I don't masturbate
Come in Saks with me, I could show you how the rappers play
Saying that you punch on fast beats? You a copycat
I could really preach 'bout this piece, feel like Gandhi ass
Reaching over here? All he grabbed was a body bag
Running 'round like I'm Terry Crews, with my cocky-ass
